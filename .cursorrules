## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


A knowledge work management system built around three core capabilities: signal extraction from meetings, hierarchical knowledge organization, and AI-assisted workflow management.

## Core Business Systems

### Knowledge Organization (Importance: 90/100)
- DIKW (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) pyramid implementation
- Hierarchical knowledge transformation rules
- Knowledge synthesis patterns across meetings and documents
- Graph-based relationship mapping between knowledge items

### Meeting Intelligence (Importance: 85/100)
- Signal extraction system categorizing:
  - Decisions
  - Action Items
  - Blockers
  - Risks
  - Ideas
- Custom conversation history tracking
- Context-aware suggestion generation
- Business-specific clarification handling

### Sprint Management (Importance: 80/100)
- Sprint cycle workflow implementation
- Custom archival process with time tracking
- Sprint mode progress tracking (A-G modes)
- Ticket backlog management system
- AI-powered standup analysis

### Career Development System (Importance: 75/100)
- Career signal extraction from standups
- Code locker analysis for productivity
- Ticket-to-capability mapping
- Work pattern analysis
- Growth suggestion generation

## Integration Points

- Meeting signals feed into DIKW pyramid for synthesis
- Sprint management connects with knowledge organization
- Career development signals integrate with knowledge base
- Context-aware routing between all components
