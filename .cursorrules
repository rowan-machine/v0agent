## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The project implements an AI-powered knowledge management and workflow automation system with several core components:

## Knowledge Processing Pipeline (Importance: 90/100)
- DIKW (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) hierarchy implementation
- Signal extraction from meetings and documents
- Custom knowledge promotion rules between hierarchy levels
- Automated synthesis and relationship mapping
- Contextual tagging and classification system

## Project Management Intelligence (Importance: 85/100)
- Sprint lifecycle orchestration with custom workflows
- Meeting signal extraction and categorization (decisions, actions, blockers)
- Ticket management with AI-powered decomposition
- Implementation planning with status tracking
- Working days calculation and sprint metrics

## Career Development System (Importance: 80/100)
- Standup analysis with AI feedback mechanisms
- Growth pattern recognition across updates
- Skills-to-project mapping
- Career coaching integration
- Historical trend analysis

## Agent Communication Architecture (Importance: 85/100)
- Multi-agent messaging system with priority routing
- Domain-specific command processing
- Context-aware query planning
- Meeting intelligence extraction
- Source-specific embedding strategies

## Knowledge Graph Implementation (Importance: 90/100)
- Custom schema for project signals and relationships
- Automated entity extraction and linking
- Semantic relationship creation
- Person/topic mapping
- DIKW pyramid relationship tracking

Key integration points connect these systems through:
1. Meeting content processing pipeline
2. Signal extraction and classification
3. Knowledge promotion workflows
4. Career development tracking
5. Sprint management integration
