## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Core Business Intelligence Platform

Primary Components:

1. AI Memory Management (src/app/api/v1/ai_memory.py)
Importance Score: 95/100
- Semantic memory storage system for AI context preservation
- Priority-based memory management (1-10 scoring)
- Vector embeddings for semantic retrieval
- Memory lifecycle with approval/rejection workflow

2. DIKW Knowledge Pyramid (src/app/api/v1/dikw.py) 
Importance Score: 90/100
- Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom hierarchy implementation
- Validation-based promotion between DIKW levels
- Confidence scoring for knowledge items
- Hierarchical relationship tracking between items
- Content synthesis across knowledge levels

3. Signal Feedback System (src/app/api/v1/feedback.py)
Importance Score: 85/100
- AI signal extraction confidence learning
- User feedback integration for extraction accuracy
- Holistic confidence scoring based on patterns
- DIKW confidence score updates from validation

4. Mindmap Analysis Engine (src/app/api/v1/imports/mindmap.py)
Importance Score: 85/100
- Vision AI for meeting mindmap processing
- Hierarchical structure extraction
- Pattern identification and insight generation
- Automatic DIKW item creation
- Visual pattern to knowledge mapping

Architecture Overview:
- Centralized knowledge management through DIKW pyramid
