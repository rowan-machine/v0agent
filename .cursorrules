## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The project implements an AI-powered knowledge management and meeting intelligence system built around four core components:

1. AI Assistant Widget (Importance: 85/100)
src/app/templates/components/assistant_widget.html
- Domain-specific conversation handling with 24-hour persistence
- Business context-aware suggestion management
- Command history analytics with pattern tracking
- Meeting and ticket workflow integration

2. DIKW Knowledge System (Importance: 90/100)
src/app/agents/dikw_synthesizer.py
- Hierarchical knowledge pyramid (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom)
- Confidence-based knowledge promotion rules
- Custom merging algorithms for knowledge synthesis
- Tag-based semantic clustering

3. Meeting Intelligence (Importance: 85/100)
src/app/agents/meeting_analyzer.py
- Multi-source transcript processing (Pocket AI, Teams)
- Signal extraction for decisions, actions, blockers, risks
- Template-based meeting analysis (30+ formats)
- Automated mindmap generation

4. Career Development Logic (Importance: 80/100)
src/app/api/career_supabase_helper.py
- Skill proficiency tracking with delta calculations
- Evidence-based progression validation
- Memory-based learning patterns
- Standup analysis with sentiment detection

The system's core value comes from its sophisticated knowledge management approach, combining:
- Intelligent signal extraction from meetings
- Hierarchical knowledge organization
- Career development tracking
- Context-aware AI assistance

Business workflows are organized around:
- Sprint-based operations
- Meeting intelligence
- Knowledge synthesis
- Professional development
