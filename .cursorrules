## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


A specialized organizational knowledge processing system focused on extracting structured insights from meetings and managing organizational knowledge. The system operates through four main business components:

## Meeting Processing Pipeline (85/100)
Located in src/app/mcp/extract.py and src/app/mcp/parser.py, this component:
- Extracts structured signals from unstructured meeting notes
- Identifies domain-specific sections including Decisions, Action Items, Blockers, Risks, and Ideas
- Prioritizes extraction from "Synthesized Signals (Authoritative)" sections
- Normalizes meeting summaries according to organizational standards

## Signal Extraction System (80/100)
Located in src/app/mcp/tools.py, handles:
- Processing of meeting bundles containing summaries, transcripts, and signals
- Domain-specific signal categorization and extraction
- Organization-specific document hierarchy management
- Business-specific JSON transformation for signal persistence

## Memory and Retrieval System (75/100)
Located in src/app/memory/rank.py, provides:
- Organizational knowledge retrieval with custom ranking
- Source type preference handling between meetings and documents
- Time-based relevance scoring
- Business context-aware term matching

## Question-Answer Processing (70/100)
Located in src/app/chat/planner.py, manages:
- Organizational knowledge base query planning
- Source preference handling for different content types
- Temporal context understanding for queries
- Organization-specific response formatting
