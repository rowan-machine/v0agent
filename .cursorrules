## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Core Business Logic Architecture:

1. Knowledge Management Core (90/100)
Path: src/app/api/v1/dikw.py
- DIKW pyramid implementation for knowledge evolution
- Promotion workflows between Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom levels
- Confidence scoring system for knowledge items
- Custom validation rules for level transitions

2. AI Memory System (85/100)
Path: src/app/api/v1/ai_memory.py
- Contextual memory storage with importance scoring
- Memory lifecycle management (approval/archive/rejection)
- Semantic search over memory items
- Context-aware memory retrieval for AI systems

3. Signal Intelligence Pipeline (85/100)
Path: src/app/domains/signals/api/extraction.py
- Extracts structured signals from meetings/documents
- Categorizes into decisions/actions/blockers/risks
- Implements deduplication with semantic similarity
- Manages signal feedback and learning loops

4. Career Development Intelligence (80/100)
Path: src/app/agents/career_coach.py
- Career growth recommendations engine
- Skill tracking and proficiency scoring
- Standup analysis with sentiment detection
- AI-driven development suggestions

5. Sprint Context Management (80/100)
Path: src/app/agents/context.py
- Sprint phase detection and mode switching
- Progress tracking with checklist analysis
- Action item consolidation
- Test plan monitoring

Integration Architecture:
- Signals flow through extraction → validation → DIKW promotion
- Memory system provides context to AI interactions
- Career tracking integrates with sprint management
- Knowledge synthesis occurs across all components

Key Business Patterns:
1. Knowledge Evolution: Data items progress through DIKW hierarchy
2. Signal Processing: Unstructured content → Structured signals → Actionable items
3. Context Preservation: Memory system maintains relevance across interactions
4. Feedback Loops: User feedback drives system learning and confidence scoring
