## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Knowledge management platform specializing in meeting information and document synthesis with temporal organization and context-aware retrieval capabilities.

- Document/meeting mixing with 6-source context limit
- Structured responses with source attribution
- Domain-specific system prompts for meeting content

## Information Organization

### Meeting/Document Synthesis
- Dual storage tracks for meetings and document content
- Date-aware content organization model
- UTC-based temporal consistency
- Source-specific formatting and prioritization
- Structured attribution system for knowledge sources

### Knowledge Integration
- Meeting-centric data modeling
- Temporal organization of institutional knowledge
- Multi-source context assembly
- Context-aware response generation with citation requirements
