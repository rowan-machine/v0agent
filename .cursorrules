Most other files contain standard templating and UI implementations without significant business logic.

---

After analyzing the provided source code files, I've determined this code group is primarily composed of templating files that handle the UI/UX presentation layer for meetings, standups, sprints and tickets. While they contain some interactive features, they don't contain significant unique business logic.

ASSESSMENT: IRRELEVANT

Reasoning:
- The files are HTML templates with embedded styling and basic JavaScript functionality
- They implement standard UI patterns for displaying and managing typical project management entities
- The code primarily handles:
  - Form rendering and submission
  - Modal dialogs
  - Data display formatting
  - Basic CRUD operations
  - Common UI interactions
  - Style definitions
- No complex business algorithms or unique domain logic is present
- The functionality is typical for any project management system

The files provided are UI implementation details rather than core business logic components. While they're important for the application's functionality, they don't contain domain-specific algorithms or unique business processes that warrant detailed analysis.
