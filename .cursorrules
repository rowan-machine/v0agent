## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The project implements an AI-assisted workflow management system with three primary business domains:

## Knowledge Management System (Importance: 90/100)
- DIKW (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) pyramid implementation
- Intelligent signal extraction and categorization
- Knowledge synthesis algorithms for merging related items
- Custom confidence scoring with validation metrics
- Tag clustering and mindmap generation
Key File: src/app/agents/dikw_synthesizer.py

## Meeting Intelligence Platform (Importance: 85/100)
- Adaptive meeting format analysis
- Multi-category signal extraction (decisions, actions, risks)
- Screenshot analysis with vision AI integration
- Semantic signal grouping and deduplication
- Meeting bundle processing with knowledge classification
Key File: src/app/agents/meeting_analyzer.py

## Career Development Engine (Importance: 80/100)
- Career profile-based suggestion generation
- Standup analysis with sentiment detection 
- Role-specific progression pathways
