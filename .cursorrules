## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a sophisticated AI-assisted project management and knowledge organization platform with several key business components:

## Core Business Logic Areas

### AI Assistant Framework (85/100)
- Stateful conversation management with 24-hour context expiration
- Intelligent command categorization using emoji mapping
- Rotating contextual suggestion system with 4 sets of domain-specific actions
- Model switching logic between GPT-4 and Claude with conversation persistence

### Knowledge Management System (90/100)
- DIKW (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) hierarchy implementation
- Custom knowledge synthesis and promotion algorithms
- Multi-level signal merging with confidence scoring
- Semantic deduplication of knowledge items
- Tag-based clustering for knowledge organization

### Meeting Intelligence Platform (85/100)
- Signal extraction system for 5 core types: decisions, actions, blockers, risks, ideas
- Custom signal lifecycle management with approval workflows
- Meeting-based signal grouping and organization
- Multi-source transcript processing with adaptive format parsing

### Career Development Framework (80/100)
- Standup management with sentiment analysis
- AI-powered feedback system with themed categorization
- Sprint coach integration for career guidance
- Skills-based progression tracking
- Role-based performance evaluation

### Agent Communication Infrastructure (85/100)
- Multi-agent message routing with priority levels
- Domain-specific message types for coordination
- Status tracking with persistence
- Custom retry logic and TTL handling

## Critical Implementation Files

- src/app/agents/dikw_synthesizer.py: Knowledge hierarchy implementation
- src/app/mcp/extract.py: Signal processing system
- src/app/agents/meeting_analyzer.py: Meeting intelligence core
- src/app/agents/career_coach.py: Career development logic
- src/app/services/agent_bus.py: Agent communication system

The system's unique value lies in its integrated approach to knowledge management, meeting intelligence, and career development, with sophisticated AI assistance throughout all workflows.
