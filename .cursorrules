## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Business Architecture (Score: 85/100)

The AI assistant system is built around three primary business components:

### 1. Conversation Management System
- 24-hour conversation persistence with automatic cleanup
- Contextual history tracking for AI interactions
- Rotating suggestion sets across sessions
- Command frequency analysis and pattern detection
- Intelligent categorization with emoji mapping

### 2. AI Memory & Signal Processing
Key paths:
- src/app/api/v1/ai_memory.py
- src/app/api/v1/feedback.py

Components:
- Semantic search with importance-based prioritization 
- Memory lifecycle management with approval states
- Self-improving signal extraction system
- Confidence scoring with user feedback loop
- Historical pattern recognition for confidence boosting

### 3. Knowledge Processing Pipeline
Key paths:
- src/app/agents/dikw_synthesizer.py
- src/app/agents/meeting_analyzer.py

Features:
- Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy processing
- Signal promotion through knowledge levels
- Domain-specific signal categorization
- Semantic deduplication with context preservation
- Business-specific content filtering and validation

## Integration Architecture

The system connects through:
- Hybrid retrieval combining importance scores and semantic relevance
- Token-aware context assembly for LLM injection
- Pattern-based confidence boosting
- Entity-specific sync strategies
- Custom dismissal/restoration workflows
