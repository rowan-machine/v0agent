## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a sophisticated knowledge management and workflow platform with several key business components:

1. Knowledge Graph & DIKW System (Importance: 95/100)
- DIKW pyramid implementation for transforming data through information and knowledge into wisdom
- Custom promotion logic between hierarchy levels
- Multi-view graph visualization with tag-based clustering
- Signal extraction and categorization system

2. Meeting Intelligence Pipeline (Importance: 90/100) 
- Structured signal extraction from meetings (decisions, actions, blockers, risks)
- Multi-source transcript merging
- Automated summary generation
- Meeting bundle processing system

3. Workflow Management (Importance: 85/100)
- Configurable workflow modes with step tracking
- Sprint points burndown visualization
- Task-based progress calculation 
- Custom mode-specific checklists

4. Assistant Intelligence (Importance: 85/100)
- Context-aware command suggestions
- Conversation history with 24-hour expiration
- Intelligent command categorization
- Command frequency/recency hybrid sorting

5. Career Development Framework (Importance: 80/100)
- Technical specialization tracking
- Multi-timeline goal management
- Skills progression framework 
- Career metrics dashboard

Core Business Concepts:
- Knowledge hierarchy management through DIKW model
- Sprint-based workflow system with configurable modes
- Meeting signal extraction and processing
- Career development and skills tracking
- Command-driven workflow automation

The system's primary value lies in its sophisticated knowledge management capabilities, particularly the DIKW implementation and meeting intelligence features. These are tightly integrated with workflow automation and career development tracking to create a comprehensive professional development platform.
