## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Project implements an AI-powered workflow management system with sophisticated meeting intelligence and signal processing capabilities.

Core Business Components (Importance: 85/100):

1. AI Assistant System
- Maintains 24-hour conversation history with contextual awareness
- Command categorization with domain-specific handlers:
  * Sprint operations (📊)
  * Ticket management (🎫)
  * Task creation (➕)
  * Meeting queries (📅)
  * Blocked items (🚫)
- Supports dynamic AI model switching while preserving context
- Custom suggestion rotation using frequency-based ranking

2. Meeting Signal Processing (src/app/mcp/extract.py)
- Extracts structured signals from meetings:
  * Decisions
  * Action items
  * Blockers
  * Risks
  * Ideas
- Implements hierarchical signal categorization
- Time-aware signal filtering with sprint integration

3. Workflow Mode System (src/app/api/settings.py)
- 7-mode progression system:
  * Context Distillation
  * Implementation Planning
  * Assisted Draft Intake
  * Deep Review & Validation
  * Promotion Readiness
  * Controlled Ingress/Egress
  * Code Execution
- Phase-specific theme adaptation
- Custom mode transitions with sprint integration

4. Knowledge Management
- Graph-based knowledge representation
- Tag-based clustering for topic organization
- Signal extraction with relationship inference
- Meeting bundle processing pipeline
- Sprint-aware knowledge evolution tracking

5. Career Development Integration
- AI-assisted task decomposition
- Implementation planning system
- Sprint point management
- Progress tracking with completion states
- Standup pattern analysis

Key Integration Points:
- Meeting intelligence feeds signal processing
- Signals drive sprint management
- Knowledge graph maintains relationships
- Career tracking integrates across components
