## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements an organizational knowledge management platform centered around intelligent querying of meetings and documents through a conversational interface.

## Core Components

### Meeting and Document Query System (85/100)
Location: src/app/chat/planner.py
- Translates natural language into structured search parameters
- Determines optimal source selection between meetings and documents
- Extracts key concepts for contextual searching
- Processes temporal hints for time-based queries
- Enforces query planning validation rules

### Memory Retrieval Engine (80/100)
Location: src/app/memory/retrieve.py
- Executes hybrid queries across meetings and documents
- Implements domain-specific relevance scoring
- Maintains temporal ordering of retrieved content
- Handles multi-source information synthesis

### Context Building System (75/100)
Location: src/app/chat/context.py
- Assembles conversational memory context
- Manages context window limitations
- Preserves conversation coherence
- Combines historical context with memory blocks

### Chat Turn Management (70/100)
Location: src/app/chat/turn.py
- Orchestrates conversation flow
- Manages conversation state persistence
- Implements query planning fallbacks
- Integrates retrieval with active context

## System Architecture

The platform operates on a hybrid document/meeting memory model with:
- Multi-stage query planning and execution pipeline
- Temporal-aware information retrieval
- Conversational access to organizational knowledge
- Context-aware memory integration
