He messaged me.\r\nJohnathan Neil 6 minutes 24 seconds\r\nLooks like we got James and Rowan. I don't know if Rob. Rob's probably busy, but if we wanna start with the.\r\nJohnathan Neil 6 minutes 37 seconds\r\nAt the beginning ceremonies of PTO and stuff, we can get started I think.\r\n\r\nJeff Rix\r\n6 minutes 43 seconds6:43\r\nJeff Rix 6 minutes 43 seconds\r\nAll right, if we're going top left to right, I'm I'm off tomorrow and no PTO after that.\r\n\ue77b\r\nSpeaker 1\r\n6 minutes 51 seconds6:51\r\n@1 6 minutes 51 seconds\r\nHey, I was top left and you jumped in front of me, dude. I'm joking. No, I'm joking. I have nothing planned.\r\n\r\nJeff Rix\r\n6 minutes 54 seconds6:54\r\nJeff Rix 6 minutes 54 seconds\r\nOh.\r\nKS\r\n\r\nKristen Stephens\r\n6 minutes 59 seconds6:59\r\nKristen Stephens 6 minutes 59 seconds\r\nI'm top left.\r\n\ue77b\r\nSpeaker 1\r\n7 minutes 1 second7:01\r\n@1 7 minutes 1 second\r\nSee.\r\nKS\r\n\r\nKristen Stephens\r\n7 minutes 3 seconds7:03\r\nKristen Stephens 7 minutes 3 seconds\r\nNothing planned for you, Chris, did you say?\r\n\ue77b\r\nSpeaker 1\r\n7 minutes 6 seconds7:06\r\n@1 7 minutes 6 seconds\r\nOh.\r\nKS\r\nKristen Stephens\r\n47 minutes 8 seconds47:08\r\nKristen Stephens 47 minutes 8 seconds\r\nSo, so Ryan or I don't know how much the product managers are QAing anymore now that we have.\r\nKristen Stephens 47 minutes 19 seconds\r\nThe fantastic Ryan here, but they we all have to manage our time manually for testing, so there's no automatic timer on that.\r\nJH\r\nJames Hayes\r\n47 minutes 31 seconds47:31\r\nJames Hayes 47 minutes 31 seconds\r\nSounds good.\r\nKS\r\nKristen Stephens\r\n47 minutes 34 seconds47:34\r\nKristen Stephens 47 minutes 34 seconds\r\nThe other thing that that does when you drag your own ticket to in process, because if I drag your ticket, it'll assign it to me and it'll assign me as the developer and so then I have to go and manually fix that. But the other thing that happens is once you finally do get it to QA when.\r\nKristen Stephens 47 minutes 54 seconds\r\nI N picks it up and starts testing it. If he finds anything wrong with it, he'll reopen it and it'll reassign it to you automatically. And then similarly, if he doesn't find anything wrong with it, or if you've already fixed everything that he's found.\r\nKristen Stephens 48 minutes 11 seconds\r\nWhen he moves it to accepted, it'll mark him as the person who did the QA, essentially saying I'm the one who accepted this thing as done.\r\nKristen Stephens 48 minutes 24 seconds\r\nI think that's it that I have.\r\nKristen Stephens 48 minutes 27 seconds\r\nOther than I need to set up a meeting with a couple of you guys.\r\nKristen Stephens 48 minutes 32 seconds\r\nJust to talk through some of this lovely housekeeping.\r\nKristen Stephens 48 minutes 40 seconds\r\nAnd also, for all of you guys that are new, I always tell everybody that I can't code. I mean, if you want to spend the time teaching me, I'd be willing to learn, but I can't code. So I'll teach you all this housekeeping stuff, but I will take the overhead for you. I want you to spend your time.\r\nKristen Stephens 48 minutes 58 seconds\r\nDoing the stuff that I can't do.\r\nKristen Stephens 49 minutes 7 seconds\r\nOK, that's all I have.\r\n\r\nNathan Stewart\r\n49 minutes 14 seconds49:14\r\nNathan Stewart 49 minutes 14 seconds\r\nThank you, Kristen. We appreciate you.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n49 minutes 17 seconds49:17\r\nJohnathan Neil 49 minutes 17 seconds\r\nMhm.\r\nKS\r\nKristen Stephens\r\n49 minutes 19 seconds49:19\r\nKristen Stephens 49 minutes 19 seconds\r\nIt goes both ways, Nathan.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n49 minutes 28 seconds49:28\r\nRobert Burcham 49 minutes 28 seconds\r\nJonathan, can I get you for like 3 or 4 minutes?\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n49 minutes 33 seconds49:33\r\nJohnathan Neil 49 minutes 33 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n49 minutes 36 seconds49:36\r\nRobert Burcham 49 minutes 36 seconds\r\nOK.\r\nKS\r\nKristen Stephens\r\n49 minutes 37 seconds49:37\r\nKristen Stephens 49 minutes 37 seconds\r\nAll right.

So success on that front is having those automated, getting that data to land automatically, not having the analyst involved in that process other than.\r\nJeremy Theriault 0 minutes 18 seconds\r\nThen like giving the initial requirements to get a new feed set up, we have about. It's probably grown now. At one point there was like 50 different PBMS we were getting data for, and every one of those PBMS have a different layout. I shouldn't say every.\r\nJeremy Theriault 0 minutes 35 seconds\r\n95%, there's some overlap. So we have to have all these different workflows for every different PBM, right? And every PBM is getting both claims and eligibility if we can get it, but at the very least claims. So it ends up being 100, right?\r\nJeremy Theriault 0 minutes 55 seconds\r\n'Cause there's two for every 50 PBM's, and I think we're up to over, maybe closer to 60 PBM's now.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 2 seconds\r\nSo that's like the initial like let's just take what we have today that's a semi manual process and get it automated, make sure that whatever we automate is having the same results that we would expect through the process we have today, right? The logic's being applied correctly and all that.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n1 minute 18 seconds1:18\r\nRowan Neri 1 minute 18 seconds\r\nOK.\r\nJT\r\n\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n1 minute 19 seconds1:19\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 19 seconds\r\nAfter that.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 21 seconds\r\nThere's always been the idea of like, OK, we can do more on top of that once we've built it so we can build layers to be able to audit the claims right for accuracy. And like we have manual test books that we can drop claims into and it runs 30 tests right that are kind of aggregations that we can look and say, hey.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 41 seconds\r\nIs this within what we would expect kind of of the benchmarks, right? If not, like we should look at that more closely. There's also the idea of just looking like every month to be like, hey, is there big fluctuations here? Like did the claims double from last month to this month? Well, something's probably wrong, right?\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n1 minute 57 seconds1:57\r\nRowan Neri 1 minute 57 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n23 minutes 33 seconds23:33\r\nJohnathan Neil 23 minutes 33 seconds\r\nMonkey patch like the end config if they need to. But yeah, the way that I'm trying to design Dags and Dag tasks is to separate the environment config and load it into variables that can be passed into resulting.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n23 minutes 36 seconds23:36\r\nRowan Neri 23 minutes 36 seconds\r\nMhm.\r\nRowan Neri 23 minutes 47 seconds\r\nMm.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n23 minutes 49 seconds23:49\r\nJohnathan Neil 23 minutes 49 seconds\r\nBusiness logic classes because like if you think about it, we we have we have we already have tests that test the N config loading like we have N config test classes. So we don't need to test the N config loading every time we write a new DAG task, we just need to test that that DAG task is using the.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n23 minutes 59 seconds23:59\r\nRowan Neri 23 minutes 59 seconds\r\nOh.\r\nRowan Neri 24 minutes 7 seconds\r\nRight.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n24 minutes 8 seconds24:08\r\nJohnathan Neil 24 minutes 8 seconds\r\nCorrect environment, right. So if we can, I think it's more following that pattern, but yes, we can. We can definitely add some sort of abstraction layer so that it it makes it easier to test. I off the top of my head. I don't know what that would look like, but I I do know what you're saying.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n24 minutes 10 seconds24:10\r\nRowan Neri 24 minutes 10 seconds\r\nOK.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n24 minutes 28 seconds24:28\r\nJohnathan Neil 24 minutes 28 seconds\r\nUm.\r\nJohnathan Neil 24 minutes 30 seconds\r\nDoes that kind of answer your question? Yeah.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n24 minutes 30 seconds24:30\r\nRowan Neri 24 minutes 30 seconds\r\nYep. OK. Yeah, yeah. If you wanna Slack me just an example of what you're talking about so I can just take a look and see how you're doing it. So then I'm not kind of rewriting or reworking it, you know, I'm kind of taking the.\r\nRowan Neri 24 minutes 47 seconds\r\nThe tribal knowledge, I guess, so to speak.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n24 minutes 50 seconds24:50\r\nJohnathan Neil 24 minutes 50 seconds\r\nYeah, sure. I mean it's just in in the unit tests there are transform tests and the RX, the test RX that reprise transform. I don't know if I laid out my business logic.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n24 minutes 54 seconds24:54\r\nRowan Neri 24 minutes 54 seconds\r\nUh.\r\nRowan Neri 24 minutes 58 seconds\r\nOh, OK.\r\nRowan Neri 24 minutes 58 seconds\r\nOh, OK.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n25 minutes 4 seconds25:04\r\nJohnathan Neil 25 minutes 4 seconds\r\nIn a very good ways, but I I was able to write like specific targeted tests against the business logic instead of like loading and configs to do stuff so.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n25 minutes 16 seconds25:16\r\nRowan Neri 25 minutes 16 seconds\r\nRight, right. OK, cool. I'll take a look. Thank you.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n25 minutes 21 seconds25:21\r\nJohnathan Neil 25 minutes 21 seconds\r\nYeah, no problem, man.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n25 minutes 24 seconds25:24\r\nRowan Neri 25 minutes 24 seconds\r\nAwesome. Thanks for setting this up, Jeremy. I appreciate it.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n25 minutes 24 seconds25:24\r\nJohnathan Neil 25 minutes 24 seconds\r\nOK.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n25 minutes 27 seconds25:27\r\nJeremy Theriault 25 minutes 27 seconds\r\nYeah, no, thanks for jumping right in. It was like we're talking about the right thing.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n25 minutes 30 seconds25:30\r\nJohnathan Neil 25 minutes 30 seconds\r\nAnd if if anything else comes up man, like just message me, I can chat with you. I I everyone does it and needs to do it like it so.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n25 minutes 40 seconds25:40\r\nRowan Neri 25 minutes 40 seconds\r\nYeah, I'm still trying to figure out who's response, like who owns what area, just because.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n25 minutes 45 seconds25:45\r\nJohnathan Neil 25 minutes 45 seconds\r\nIt yeah, and if you need to know who owns something, you can ask me too. Like I I just feel free to to reach out to me. No, no problem.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n25 minutes 50 seconds25:50\r\nRowan Neri 25 minutes 50 seconds\r\nOK. Appreciate that.\r\nRowan Neri 25 minutes 55 seconds\r\nThanks a lot. All right.

Thanks.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n28 minutes 56 seconds28:56\r\nJeremy Theriault 28 minutes 56 seconds\r\nYeah, there's a lot of things that we get from PVM's that we don't even land in there like they'll send us to Social Security on the file and we're not ingesting that, but it's there in the underlying claim file.\r\nJeremy Theriault 29 minutes 11 seconds\r\nAlright, I think everyone can drop and Rob, I'll just take it for 2 minutes.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n29 minutes 16 seconds29:16\r\nJohnathan Neil 29 minutes 16 seconds\r\nAlright, later guys.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n29 minutes 17 seconds29:17\r\nRobert Burcham 29 minutes 17 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nRobert Burcham 29 minutes 22 seconds\r\nYeah, I was familiar with SSN because that that's a field that gets hashed when we produced a hash go to production.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n29 minutes 28 seconds29:28\r\nJeremy Theriault 29 minutes 28 seconds\r\nOn.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n29 minutes 31 seconds29:31\r\nRobert Burcham 29 minutes 31 seconds\r\nBut I'm I'm looking at ingesting through workflow and the comment that you made that like Ken and Jeff got together simply just kind of reimplement Ken's direct API calls and clearly what we're going to do is workflow. We're going to land all the stuff so we persist it and we have a history over time we will do roll up.\r\nRobert Burcham 29 minutes 50 seconds\r\nAnd aggregations and counts and all the metadata that's associated with it and ingest things into through API call. And if there's PHI in there, then we need to make sure that we're managing the PHI. How can I help you?\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n30 minutes 6 seconds30:06\r\nJeremy Theriault 30 minutes 6 seconds\r\nJust a quick comment. So I had been talking to Johnathan last week and he's doing a lot of rework, or at least managing a lot of rework with Jeff.

And Jason just wanted to make sure that I got with you and shared that feedback.

    "content": "=== Teams Transcript ===\nJeremy Theriault\r\n0 minutes 3 seconds0:03\r\nJeremy Theriault 0 minutes 3 seconds\r\nJust very briefly, my background, so you guys know. So I started on the broker side, which we'll talk about here in a second, basically who our clients are. So I started on the broker side, spent nine years as a consultant doing pharmacy work on that side of business. That's how I met Jason Wenski when he was selling.\r\nJeremy Theriault 0 minutes 21 seconds\r\nFor a company called Rx Benefits. When he started the Rx product here, I joined kind of right as he was starting to build it. And so I've been here for three years. My job has been varied, but now my focus is much more on product. My title will officially.\r\nJeremy Theriault 0 minutes 38 seconds\r\nChange to product owner right where I'll be working with you guys kind of on building out the requirements for what we need to do in the system.\r\nJeremy Theriault 0 minutes 47 seconds\r\nWith that, unless you guys have any other initial questions, I'll start talking about the ecosystem here.\r\n0:55\r\n0 minutes 55 seconds\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\nMike Mathis\r\n0 minutes 57 seconds0:57\r\nMike Mathis 0 minutes 57 seconds\r\nSounds good.\r\nJT\r\n\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n0 minutes 57 seconds0:57\r\nJeremy Theriault 0 minutes 57 seconds\r\nAll right, this is super rough. It's not pretty, but it's effective enough in being able to convey the different players in the ecosystem. So we sit in the middle of the PBM industry, but we can start kind of all the way on the right of this diagram. So on the very right hand side is the end.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 17 seconds\r\nEnd consumer, which is gonna be the employer group. So everyone who is an employee of a company that offers health insurance, right, gets an ID card for their medical and pharmacy coverage, right? Sometimes it's two cards, sometimes it's one. But ultimately the people all the way at the end of this ecosystem are the employer groups who are.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 36 seconds\r\nOffering pharmacy coverage to their employees.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 41 seconds\r\nThey're going to work with a broker to obtain that pharmacy coverage, right? So an employer doesn't have the expertise or time to be able to go out and market their own pharmacy coverage. So they'll rely on a broker.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 5 minutes 2 seconds\r\nAnd say, hey, the claims data you uploaded had these months of claims and this is the amount of claims in each month. This just helps you understand like what months had the data in it and say like sometimes you might get 24 months of data, but the first 12 are just like lagged claims where they're really small and you don't actually want to include that in your analysis.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 5 minutes 22 seconds\r\nSo this is where you specifically say of the data I uploaded, this is what I want to use when I analyze these claims.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 5 minutes 30 seconds\r\nSo we would select the claims and hit calculate.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 5 minutes 35 seconds\r\nAt this point, it's doing that repricing I talked about and that is a whole another call. If you guys ever need to do like the ins and outs of how do you reprice pharmacy claims, it's complicated. We can walk through it, but that's what John Smith's working on right now. It's like redoing how we reprice claims in the new DMP environment.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 5 minutes 55 seconds\r\nJames and Rowan, as data engineers in the DD environment in the future, I think a lot of this work can actually be done by you guys without a John Smith needing. You guys would do all the back end work and then John Smith's more.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 6 minutes 11 seconds\r\nThe front end and kind of overseeing it all to some degree. So I think that's how we envision this working with all the data engineers coming on board now.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 6 minutes 21 seconds\r\nSo you will likely at some point get the nitty gritty on how reclaims your pricing works.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 6 minutes 28 seconds\r\nUm.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 6 minutes 30 seconds\r\nThe financial summaries popped up, so this is where we see our different bidders compared. The first column here is our incumbent. Then we show the bidders in order of most savings to lease savings, but you can reorder it if you'd like. Just drag and pull over.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 6 minutes 47 seconds\r\nThis top section kind of just is the those parameters that we filled out when we were building the RFP. This is so you can see if everyone quoted it the same way and you can kind of compare bitter to bitter. Down below we've repriced the gross drug cost, so you can see that and then.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 7 minutes 4 seconds\r\nYou can see the rebates we've repressed down below, et cetera. You kind of get to a whole time summary. I just noticed it's one minute till the end of this meeting because I have a 210.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 7 minutes 16 seconds\r\nSo I don't want you too in the weeds here yet, because it'll take a while to go through all this.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 7 minutes 22 seconds\r\nWhat do you guys feel like? Do you feel like you want another call to keep plowing through all of this and talk about other areas of the system? Or do you feel like you want to just kind of get your hands dirty and come back with questions?

Yeah, like integration testing.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n33 minutes 19 seconds33:19\r\nRobert Burcham 33 minutes 19 seconds\r\nWhen Jonathan Yeah, it's that really is. It's like if you're test pyramid, you have unit and component, you have integration, you have UX. The whole user experience is the top of the pyramid. The top of the pyramid is.\r\nRobert Burcham 33 minutes 38 seconds\r\nConnecting quote link over to to the DMP. But yeah, I mean, hey man, it's just your second day. So, so we're showing you the full picture here. It's the second day. You're correct. When you start grinding through all those RX audit claim things, what you're probably gonna do is you're probably just gonna focus on Ring Link DM.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n33 minutes 40 seconds33:40\r\nRowan Neri 33 minutes 40 seconds\r\nYeah, mm, cool.\r\nRowan Neri 33 minutes 44 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nRowan Neri 33 minutes 48 seconds\r\nThat's great.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n33 minutes 57 seconds33:57\r\nRobert Burcham 33 minutes 57 seconds\r\nAnd you're going to focus on, hey, are these things running in Airflow? And as long as you're keeping your registry up to date, your DAG registry up to date, then Quote Link will automatically import that registry and it will know about your DAGs. So that's how the DAGs get exposed to Quote Link is inside that registry.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n34 minutes 2 seconds34:02\r\nRowan Neri 34 minutes 2 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nRowan Neri 34 minutes 12 seconds\r\nHuh.\r\nRowan Neri 34 minutes 17 seconds\r\nRight, right.

I think you organize these things nicely and and you know you're the you're the confluence queen and and that's all presented very nicely. I think structurally during this session we we need to kind of proctor an engagement to to go each one through each one of these.\r\nRobert Burcham 0 minutes 22 seconds\r\nThrough each one of these things and and and mine them, mine them for for the for the for the richer value that are that that's being requested in in this box right here.\r\nRobert Burcham 0 minutes 32 seconds\r\nSo.\r\n0:33\r\n0 minutes 33 seconds\r\nUm, awesome.\r\nMS\r\n\r\nMitch Slavens\r\n0 minutes 34 seconds0:34\r\nMitch Slavens 0 minutes 34 seconds\r\nYeah, yeah, no, that makes sense.\r\nRB\r\n\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n0 minutes 35 seconds0:35\r\nRobert Burcham 0 minutes 35 seconds\r\nAnd and not be afraid to do that.

The one other thing I I liked that we did in the past, Kristen, was I don't think we have to go through each person, but taking the temperature of like how did everybody's last month feel, I think can be helpful because you know, it doesn't even have to be ask everybody. It could just be one survey and then we're like, OK, collectively we were like at six, so like or maybe we were in eight.\r\n\r\nJeff Rix\r\n0 minutes 48 seconds0:48\r\nJeff Rix 0 minutes 48 seconds\r\n8.\r\nKS\r\n\r\nKristen Stephens\r\n0 minutes 52 seconds0:52\r\nKristen Stephens 0 minutes 52 seconds\r\nOK.\r\nKS\r\nKristen Stephens\r\n45 minutes 29 seconds45:29\r\nKristen Stephens 45 minutes 29 seconds\r\nSure.\r\nJP\r\nJayson Parker\r\n45 minutes 30 seconds45:30\r\nJayson Parker 45 minutes 30 seconds\r\nAre we there yet? Um.\r\nJayson Parker 45 minutes 34 seconds\r\nOne thing that always concerns me is, is there's a lot of work that the devs do. I'll pick on John and Mitch specifically that they get pulled into and Mitch and I have talked about this, but truly trapping their time in all the different places that they get pulled.\r\nJayson Parker 45 minutes 53 seconds\r\nThat stuff just gets expected and you guys just soak it up and then you still have to deliver on what it is that you're being asked to do. And if the business truly doesn't have data or insights into the like if Elasticsearch is pulling on you.\r\nJayson Parker 46 minutes 9 seconds\r\nFor example, then it's never going to get better. So I would, I would just say if you guys don't do that, then it's it's kind of it's incumbent on you to to trap that. Otherwise it will never change and we can't get better from a management perspective to.\r\nJayson Parker 46 minutes 25 seconds\r\nTo solve these problems.\r\nMS\r\nMitch Slavens\r\n46 minutes 28 seconds46:28\r\nMitch Slavens 46 minutes 28 seconds\r\nYeah, that makes sense. That's definitely one of my goals for this year is to do a better job of tracking my time that isn't to like a particular workable ticket, right? And so I I'm working on that just so that a so I can paint a picture for myself of like where my time is being spent.\r\nJP\r\nJayson Parker\r\n46 minutes 29 seconds46:29\r\nJayson Parker 46 minutes 29 seconds\r\nUm.\r\nMS\r\nMitch Slavens\r\n46 minutes 46 seconds46:46\r\nMitch Slavens 46 minutes 46 seconds\r\nSo I can be like, well, the day's over, like what did I get done? And then it's like, OK, I can go back and look and be, yeah, if I need to communicate that elsewhere, it helps for product owners to have a realistic view of how much capacity we have right to to work on feature work. And the best way to know that is by tracking.\r\nMitch Slavens 47 minutes 3 seconds\r\nWhat we're spending time on. So that is her Jason and I will take that. That is one of my big goals for this year. I say this year like that was on my performance eval or whatever, so.\r\nJP\r\nJayson Parker\r\n47 minutes 12 seconds47:12\r\nJayson Parker 47 minutes 12 seconds\r\nI I bet there's a 30 to 40% time that just doesn't get that nobody understands, if not more, right?\r\nMS\r\nMitch Slavens\r\n47 minutes 19 seconds47:19\r\nMitch Slavens 47 minutes 19 seconds\r\n100%, yeah, yeah. Just depends on the week, right? Yeah.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n47 minutes 21 seconds47:21\r\nRobert Burcham 47 minutes 21 seconds\r\nOr you have to dig. You have to dig to find it because and what you're talking about is production support. What you're talking about is operation support. You're you're you're talking about you know Ken's got duplicate claims or or you know some mystery that's got to be solved and it's it's accounted for in a ticket that is not associated directly.\r\nMS\r\nMitch Slavens\r\n47 minutes 27 seconds47:27\r\nMitch Slavens 47 minutes 27 seconds\r\nUh, yeah.\r\nJP\r\nJayson Parker\r\n47 minutes 34 seconds47:34\r\nJayson Parker 47 minutes 34 seconds\r\nRight, 100%.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n47 minutes 41 seconds47:41\r\nRobert Burcham 47 minutes 41 seconds\r\nWith a Sprint in in in an issue tracking situation. So you you you kind of have to dig it out and and and and find it. So maybe there's a mechanic that we can do like we can tag or bless these kinds of tickets so that they can be reported in like a macro type of view.\r\nMS\r\nMitch Slavens\r\n47 minutes 42 seconds47:42\r\nMitch Slavens 47 minutes 42 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nJP\r\nJayson Parker\r\n47 minutes 55 seconds47:55\r\nJayson Parker 47 minutes 55 seconds\r\nYep. And and Kristen can certainly. I know that she's got our a pulse on this, but she can help us tell that story. That should be something that we're telling on a reoccurring basis, so.\r\nMS\r\nMitch Slavens\r\n48 minutes 8 seconds48:08\r\nMitch Slavens 48 minutes 8 seconds\r\nYeah, that makes sense. And that is a good point, Rob. I think that ultimately that's how it needs to go. Yeah. Ad hoc, yeah.\r\nJP\r\nJayson Parker\r\n48 minutes 11 seconds48:11\r\nJayson Parker 48 minutes 11 seconds\r\nUnplanned work.

And then here's a box for you to type in a whatever else, right?\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n46 minutes 49 seconds46:49\r\nJohnathan Neil 46 minutes 49 seconds\r\nYeah, we do.\r\nJohnathan Neil 46 minutes 56 seconds\r\nWe we do in one spot, but um.\r\nJohnathan Neil 47 minutes\r\nThat so, so the interesting thing there is that we're going to have a foreign key to this table basically, and the foreign key will be 2466 if they pick the silver formulary if we need to record.\r\nJohnathan Neil 47 minutes 16 seconds\r\nA a name we we would have to have two fields to represent the reallocation list. So like we would then have to save a name so.\r\nJohnathan Neil 47 minutes 30 seconds\r\nIt wouldn't be structured in any way, but we can do it if that makes sense.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n47 minutes 38 seconds47:38\r\nJeremy Theriault 47 minutes 38 seconds\r\nI'm not sure I'm following. So I'm the I'm the PBM user. I'm responding to an RFP. There's the spot where it says formulary name, which today is just an open text field. We'll make that sometime a drop down right where I click it and I will see silver, gold, platinum, right. It'll just populate every formulary name that is.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n47 minutes 45 seconds47:45\r\nJohnathan Neil 47 minutes 45 seconds\r\nMhm.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n47 minutes 57 seconds47:57\r\nJeremy Theriault 47 minutes 57 seconds\r\nAnd it's now we know on the back end that silver's 2466 and gold's 2467, whatever. I can select one of those options, or I can type in whatever formula name, at which point we don't care about the ID because we're not actually tying that back. That's just literally, oh, I see, but you're going to have to store that name.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n48 minutes 12 seconds48:12\r\nJohnathan Neil 48 minutes 12 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nJohnathan Neil 48 minutes 14 seconds\r\nYep, so that that's fine. If if we need it, then we need it and we can add another like we can just reuse the formulary name field that's already there and then we could we could even inject like a.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n48 minutes 14 seconds48:14\r\nJeremy Theriault 48 minutes 14 seconds\r\nRight, just like we did today.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n48 minutes 29 seconds48:29\r\nJohnathan Neil 48 minutes 29 seconds\r\nLike a fake other like and hide the formulary name field text field and then they can drop down and it'll say silver, gold, platinum other. If they click other then it pops up the the text field for them to to type it in if that makes sense.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n48 minutes 46 seconds48:46\r\nJeremy Theriault 48 minutes 46 seconds\r\nOK, yeah, whatever is achievable in the system.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n48 minutes 51 seconds48:51\r\nJohnathan Neil 48 minutes 51 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nJohnathan Neil 48 minutes 52 seconds\r\nIt should be a pretty simple ticket, but yeah, we do have. We do have places where the the drop down is populated with database tables basically, which is what this would be. So no big deal.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n49 minutes 5 seconds49:05\r\nJeremy Theriault 49 minutes 5 seconds\r\nOK.\r\nJeremy Theriault 49 minutes 7 seconds\r\nOK, um, I'll keep plugging away and build these tickets, but glad we kind of started the conversation.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n49 minutes 14 seconds49:14\r\nJohnathan Neil 49 minutes 14 seconds\r\nYeah, sounds good.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n49 minutes 18 seconds49:18\r\nJeremy Theriault 49 minutes 18 seconds\r\nAnything else you guys got?\r\nJeremy Theriault 49 minutes 21 seconds\r\nAwesome. Alright, I'd like to get. Oh, do we need the call tomorrow?\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n49 minutes 24 seconds49:24\r\nJohnathan Neil 49 minutes 24 seconds\r\nNo, I'm just kind of ad hoc conversationing with people where I need to, so we can probably drop that call permanently. I don't think we need it anymore.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n49 minutes 34 seconds49:34\r\nJeremy Theriault 49 minutes 34 seconds\r\nOK.\r\nJeremy Theriault 49 minutes 36 seconds\r\nOK, I'll take it off our calendars.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n49 minutes 39 seconds49:39\r\nJohnathan Neil 49 minutes 39 seconds\r\nSweet.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n49 minutes 40 seconds49:40\r\nJeremy Theriault 49 minutes 40 seconds\r\nAlright, see you guys.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n49 minutes 42 seconds49:42\r\nJohnathan Neil 49 minutes 42 seconds\r\nThanks.

They said it's not coming back on till around 11:30, so I'm able to join on my phone, but I can't.

I saw your eyebrows go up like woo.\r\nKW\r\nKevin Wisniewski\r\n41 minutes 49 seconds41:49\r\nKevin Wisniewski 41 minutes 49 seconds\r\nNo, I I guess that makes sense. I was I was concerned with some of the the weirdness around tracking subjects and replies, but it it might be OK.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n42 minutes 3 seconds42:03\r\nJohnathan Neil 42 minutes 3 seconds\r\nSo the reason I'm not worried about that is they're clicking. They would be clicking a button or selecting something that we should be able to get the thread ID from, so we would just pass that in their.\r\nJohnathan Neil 42 minutes 21 seconds\r\nIn the create message API, so we would probably have to modify the create message API to take a parent or.\r\nKW\r\nKevin Wisniewski\r\n42 minutes 31 seconds42:31\r\nKevin Wisniewski 42 minutes 31 seconds\r\nI I mean, I've already, I've already had to do it.

It should be easy to access the parent at that point. We should be able to know who the parent is pretty easily, unless you disagree.\r\nKW\r\nKevin Wisniewski\r\n42 minutes 49 seconds42:49\r\nKevin Wisniewski 42 minutes 49 seconds\r\nNo, I think that that probably makes sense.\r\nKevin Wisniewski 42 minutes 54 seconds\r\nYeah, I I'll have to think about it a little bit more, but yeah, we'll we'll go through it for right now and you know, go from there.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n43 minutes43:00\r\nJohnathan Neil 43 minutes\r\nOK.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n43 minutes 4 seconds43:04\r\nJeremy Theriault 43 minutes 4 seconds\r\nAlright, that's already in.\r\nJeremy Theriault 43 minutes 11 seconds\r\nRyan, I'll put two Qi for now this one.\r\nJeremy Theriault 43 minutes 16 seconds\r\nUh.\r\nJeremy Theriault 43 minutes 18 seconds\r\nThanks for bearing with me through this. I know it's stinks to have it changing kind of on the fly here. I can't guarantee that all the changes aren't done at this point either, right? If we get Mike involved, both Mike's involved, right? We might end up making some other stylistic choices, but hopefully.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n43 minutes 38 seconds43:38\r\nJohnathan Neil 43 minutes 38 seconds\r\nYeah, I I think what we have so far is good and it's malleable, so should be OK.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n43 minutes 43 seconds43:43\r\nJeremy Theriault 43 minutes 43 seconds\r\nYeah, perfect.\r\nJeremy Theriault 43 minutes 46 seconds\r\nAwesome.

So if you guys can see my screen, what I'm going to do is just like a 3 minute overview of what we did last time and then I'll go into kind of moving forward. So just as a reminder, where we're at right now is kind of halfway through the RFP process when we were together last time we worked on.\r\nJeremy Theriault 0 minutes 23 seconds\r\nCreating our RFP. The first thing we did was we came into the workspace and we had to add. If we wanted to add a group, we had to add a group by going to Records, Groups, Create group and we put in information. We joked around about how 90% of this is not needed. Mike was like.\r\nJeremy Theriault 0 minutes 42 seconds\r\nManaging at the amount of fields in here that aren't needed, right? There's a whole overhaul here that could take place. This is where we went to create a group. Once the group was created, we navigated back to the workspace. We hit Create Request, popped up at this screen. We had to select which group we wanted to create the request for, which cover sheet we wanted to use, which again, the cover sheet is.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 2 seconds\r\nWhat questions are we including in the RFP? We always have our base questions, but users can create new cover sheets with their own additional questions on top of what we ask. If we had a contract, we could have selected that to load it. When we hit create, it's going to pop up here. It's going to allow us to assign team members and then we have to.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 22 seconds\r\nFill in a bunch of information that the market needs on this cover sheet. So we went through, filled in the group information, the request information, and then we spent a lot of time here kind of talking about the different terms of the contract and what we're requesting. That's really important to make sure that the market knows what to quote, right? An open formulary is very different than a closed formulary and that's gonna.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 42 seconds\r\nImpact rates, et cetera. We talked about where fees get added down here, both our fees and the fees that the consultants are asking for. We then went through steps two and Step 3, which is where we entered the actual pricing information by channel.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 58 seconds\r\nAnd applied the different or identified which exclusions apply. Step 2 is related to the discount. So that's kind of the price that you're going to pay when you go to fill the drug at the point of sale. Rebates is that post utilization discount that after the fact rebates are paid out to.\r\nJeremy Theriault 2 minutes 16 seconds\r\nThe brokers into the groups.\r\nJeremy Theriault 2 minutes 20 seconds\r\nAnd then steps four and five and six are not required when building an RFP, but they are the same questions that the market would ask or sorry, the market would have to answer when they respond to an RFP.\r\nJeremy Theriault 2 minutes 36 seconds\r\nWe have it in here in case that it is a group that we already have in our system that we would know these answers and we would just fill this in for them if they imported from a contract, but if not, the user can just skip it. You get to the end and you hit create. Once that RFP was created, it was sitting here in our request queue. It was originally in drafting stage.\r\n\r\nRowan Neri\r\n56 minutes 4 seconds56:04\r\nRowan Neri 56 minutes 4 seconds\r\nYeah, super helpful. Thank you so much.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n56 minutes 4 seconds56:04\r\nJeremy Theriault 56 minutes 4 seconds\r\nOh.\r\nJeremy Theriault 56 minutes 8 seconds\r\nNo problem. And I'm always here obviously, so reach out if you have questions as things come up. I am kind of your point person for RX related questions. Not that the rest of the team wouldn't answer the questions for you as well, but I'm happy to be kind of the.\r\nJeremy Theriault 56 minutes 25 seconds\r\nFirst person you call and yeah, just let me know what comes up. I think Mike, I've got that ticket over to you, Rowan. I'll get that information over to you. So you guys are kind of working on things and then James, Jonathan will pull you in kind of on the things that you need to be working on.\r\nJH\r\nJames Hayes\r\n56 minutes 42 seconds56:42\r\nJames Hayes 56 minutes 42 seconds\r\nSounds good. Do you? Would it be worth sending over that PowerPoint on the whole clinical thing?\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n56 minutes 52 seconds56:52\r\nJeremy Theriault 56 minutes 52 seconds\r\nI could. It's going to be probably hard to understand without me walking through it. If you, I mean, do you want to take 15 minutes right now and walk through it? I can give you the 15 minutes 11, OK?\r\nJH\r\nJames Hayes\r\n56 minutes 53 seconds56:53\r\nJames Hayes 56 minutes 53 seconds\r\nOr.\r\nJames Hayes 56 minutes 55 seconds\r\nOK, fair enough. We can hold off then.\r\nJames Hayes 57 minutes\r\nI actually have AI have another meeting. Yeah, so that's OK.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n57 minutes 6 seconds57:06\r\nJeremy Theriault 57 minutes 6 seconds\r\nWe can pick it up some other time and I'll walk you through that PowerPoint and then I'll certainly give it to you. I just if I send it over and I'll maybe make some sense of it, maybe like, what the hell is this?\r\nJH\r\nJames Hayes\r\n57 minutes 8 seconds57:08\r\nJames Hayes 57 minutes 8 seconds\r\nSure.\r\nJames Hayes 57 minutes 11 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nJames Hayes 57 minutes 16 seconds\r\nMakes sense.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n57 minutes 16 seconds57:16\r\nJeremy Theriault 57 minutes 16 seconds\r\nYeah.

We also want to care for members in the lead team what the state of platform architecture is, what that evolution has been.\r\nRobert Burcham 0 minutes 19 seconds\r\nAnd where we are today and then focus particularly on this new entity we have in the platform architecture, the data management platform and what work have been done, where our investments have been and then in terms of the specific business workflows, where those workflows, the state of some of those workflows today.\r\nRobert Burcham 0 minutes 36 seconds\r\nWe might demo some of those sets and then there are some follow on considerations we might do that specifically relate to operations. So and I think that that'll be more of like an open conversation about now that we have a formalized.\r\nRobert Burcham 0 minutes 56 seconds\r\nOperational organ, the company, how do we represent its interests in the factory with in the orbit of product, making sure that their their priorities are also being accounted for and so that we can serve that internal customer.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 minute 13 seconds\r\nSo everybody get it. Can you guys hear OK?\r\nJT\r\n\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n1 181:18\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 minute 18 seconds\r\nYeah, we can hear you guys.\r\nRB\r\n\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n1 201:20\r\nRobert Burcham 1 minute 20 seconds\r\nOK, cool. Online, we've got JT. We have Ron Mary, who is a contracting data engineer, and we've got Nathan Stewart, full stacker and essentially engineering.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 minute 36 seconds\r\nRight now, Nathan's responsibilities in the tool stack are largely over on the stop loss SmartLink side of things. He's providing coverage because we're really shallow there right now, but our our two most recent very qualified tool stackers will be starting on 31 second. They are going to get trained up quick and they send the stemenship of.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 minute 55 seconds\r\nSmartLink and Stop Blocks, and then Nathan will be able to shift over to essentially play an engineering manager role in the DMP and we'll talk about that as I go through the Visa.\r\nRobert Burcham 2 minutes 7 seconds\r\nOK, so I'm going to put my glasses on so I can see and I'm going to share a presentation.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n1 hour 31 minutes 50 seconds1:31:50\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 31 minutes 50 seconds\r\nSo in the DMP when we process everything, we want validators to make sure that the result of the processing from signal to data are good. Then when we make the API call to dispose of the data into quote to contract, we do that with the control file to make sure the import was successful.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 32 minutes 7 seconds\r\nSo that two different classes of of validation because you're doing two different things, but each each example of aggregation that you were talking about, there's a workflow for each one of those things, and each one of those workflows gets a validator so we can implement a validation.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 32 minutes 25 seconds\r\nThat's closely associated with that workflow, yeah. And so from like a Project Management standpoint, it would be another ticket that needs to be implemented. So we would have like this is the business logic, this is how we define the business logic in the workflow and this is the validation. This is what needs to run after the workflow.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 32 minutes 44 seconds\r\nSo it would just be a separate ticket essentially or maybe a task on the same ticket potentially because if we're doing it right and we're holding ourselves to the standard, every workflow we implement implements the triple each piece. And if we don't like maybe we kind of half op or no op the allocator and if we accept it, that's fine, but.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n1 hour 32 minutes 46 seconds1:32:46\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 32 minutes 46 seconds\r\nYes.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n1 hour 33 minutes 4 seconds1:33:04\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 33 minutes 4 seconds\r\nWe gotta implement A validator when we implement the workflow.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 33 minutes 8 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 33 minutes 20 seconds\r\nWhat else can I do for you? OK, next week, right? I was gonna click on. James says if you were successful simulating events for object creates from SFTP, so I've got every.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 33 minutes 37 seconds\r\nEvery object that we have in production, that's a TT. OK And have you made any like very typical visualizations of those? I need off set up before I can even start on that before you can even start. OK, so not even on your laptop hitting that.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 33 minutes 55 seconds\r\nInflux. I can set something up locally and just make sure we'll we'll get you off set up, but don't let that stop you. If you've got a a group on on your laptop and you can hit that influence, that might be the fastest route to prototyping. I'll have to talk to Swonda because we just locked influx down to private. I see.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 34 minutes 14 seconds\r\nNo, I can't route to it. Well, you can probably bastion probably.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 34 minutes 19 seconds\r\nIsn't time.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 34 minutes 25 seconds\r\nOK, I think the other thing is just getting a backlog of.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 34 minutes 30 seconds\r\nThat's where I was. We need to have those like pond discussions, like where we want to go, how do we want to get there, what are those things? And they don't necessarily be trackable at this point, but just having the vision of where we want to go and are we designing things today to get to that?\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 34 minutes 45 seconds\r\nLike, because nothing's more frustrating than designing something one way, and then two years later you have to redesign everything because it wasn't designed how it needed to be for the big picture.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 34 minutes 58 seconds\r\nRework is always fun.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 35 minutes 4 seconds\r\nYeah, I understand. I I just think having even lists of things, right. So to JT's point, like what are those requests? Yeah, they probably change frequently too. Yeah, I think out of Maroon dumb guy brains, we're gonna make system KPIs that we're gonna put on the system.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 35 minutes 23 seconds\r\nDashboard and and then we'll work with Canon with like to make sure that like health and well-being. Sure. Yeah, product KPI, that's what I'm thinking of. I'm thinking of the clients. Yeah, yeah, I mean that is capital P product.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 35 minutes 42 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 35 minutes 50 seconds\r\nThank you everybody for the the rundown and the time.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 35 minutes 55 seconds\r\nSounds like, uh, there's a lot to do and it's probably not told you guys for doing that.\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 36 minutes 4 seconds\r\nThanks, fellas.

She's crazy. She'll just sit out there in 10 degree weather for 1/2 hour, but she's got a lot of fur. She's kind of made for the cold.\r\nKS\r\nKristen Stephens\r\n3 minutes 35 seconds\r\n3:35\r\nKristen Stephens 3 minutes 35 seconds\r\nYeah.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n1 hour 5 minutes 52 seconds\r\n1:05:52\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 5 minutes 52 seconds\r\nLike, would it be OK if we have this call, we do what we just did here. You guys can take this to the DMP call and get nerdy with them on all the specifics here. If I'm needed, let me know and I can join that call. But like I'm kind of giving you guys the information and then you take it to the the full DMP team, right?\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n1 hour 5 minutes 53 seconds\r\n1:05:53\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 5 minutes 53 seconds\r\nIn the DMV room.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n1 hour 6 minutes 11 seconds\r\n1:06:11\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 6 minutes 11 seconds\r\nAnd then, you know, saves me from being in another grooming call, if that's OK, but I'm also able to join if they do.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n1 hour 6 minutes 16 seconds\r\n1:06:16\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 6 minutes 16 seconds\r\nTotally.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n1 hour 6 minutes 19 seconds\r\n1:06:19\r\nJohnathan Neil 1 hour 6 minutes 19 seconds\r\nYeah, I and I understand these tickets and the goal of these tickets enough I can present them, I think. So I think it's, I think, I think that's a good starting point for us to get integrated with the DMP team.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n1 hour 6 minutes 25 seconds\r\n1:06:25\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 6 minutes 25 seconds\r\nOK.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 6 minutes 31 seconds\r\nOK.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n1 hour 6 minutes 35 seconds\r\n1:06:35\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 6 minutes 35 seconds\r\nYeah, this is the right model. The what we're doing with Smartlink and the stop loss side is like Nathan's kind of playing both sides of the fence. And so he's he's already intimately familiar with the full stack side and the DMP side. And this is the model I think we want to, we want to adapt to because we'll be able to bring more steel to the target.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n1 hour 6 minutes 35 seconds\r\n1:06:35\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 6 minutes 35 seconds\r\nCool.\r\nRB\r\nRobert Burcham\r\n1 hour 6 minutes 55 seconds\r\n1:06:55\r\nRobert Burcham 1 hour 6 minutes 55 seconds\r\nWith more humans.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n1 hour 6 minutes 56 seconds\r\n1:06:56\r\nJohnathan Neil 1 hour 6 minutes 56 seconds\r\nGotcha.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n1 hour 7 minutes\r\n1:07:00\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 7 minutes\r\nWho?\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 7 minutes 1 second\r\nAwesome. Well, thanks again for the time. And certainly if you have those calls and something changes where something becomes A8 versus the five, you know, let me just report that back, but.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n1 hour 7 minutes 12 seconds\r\n1:07:12\r\nJohnathan Neil 1 hour 7 minutes 12 seconds\r\nYeah, uh, can you uh, link me the epic and I'll put stuff in the DMP channel so that we can have a.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n1 hour 7 minutes 12 seconds\r\n1:07:12\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 7 minutes 12 seconds\r\nOh.\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 7 minutes 15 seconds\r\nYep.\r\nJN\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n1 hour 7 minutes 20 seconds\r\n1:07:20\r\nJohnathan Neil 1 hour 7 minutes 20 seconds\r\nWe'll have tickets to talk about in the meeting.\r\nJT\r\nJeremy Theriault\r\n1 hour 7 minutes 24 seconds\r\n1:07:24\r\nJeremy Theriault 1 hour 7 minutes 24 seconds\r\nOK, yes, I'll do that a second.

These are essentially specific ingest dags that ingest particular PBM formats.\r\nThis work would include porting the classes in dmpv1.rx_audit.* to dmpv2.

    "content": "hey so heres my understanding for rx audit claims refactor to dmvp2...\r\nit sounds like this will resolve to just one pipeline (rxauditclaims_load_v1) rather than \"all vs one\" pipelines, with that distinction handled by runtime params\r\nfrom an implementation standpoint seems like it's going to take about 4 focused classes:\r\nRxAuditPBMConfig to load and resolve the rx audit defintion files (per claim type, partner/provider)\r\nPBMConfigRegistry to cache raw definitions and pass back resolved views\r\nTransforms:\r\nPBMIngestTransformV1 - handle parquet ingestion + the existing processing and validation steps from v1\r\nRxAuditClaimsUploadV1 - manage the api upload etc via QuoteLinq service\r\nthe existing definitions-based config structure could stay as-is (multiple json files)\r\nif you agree I can go ahead and write some details in the ticket for it, lmk if you want me to do that\r\nRowan Neri\r\n  11:59 AM\r\nalso the comments are resolved in the MR and I rebased it with your recent changes as well\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n  12:05 PM\r\nreplied to a thread:\r\nhey so heres my understanding for rx audit claims refactor to dmvp2...\u2026\r\nI would be curious to know if it would be better to have a dag per partner, if there are limitations to the current pattern of one dag->many json configs.\r\nBut I think it is probably fine to port it as is.\r\nPlease do go ahead and create a ticket and add the details. We can talk about the ticket Thursday but continue working on it as you can.\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n  12:06 PM\r\nreplied to a thread:\r\nalso the comments are resolved in the MR and I rebased it with your recent changes as well\r\nOk, fix looks good. I left one more comment, sorry. I missed it on my first pass.\r\nBasically the drug lists are at the quote response level not the option.\r\nThis is a product knowledge thing. The Quote Response can have multiple Options that it is a parent to. I missed the requirement for the Quote Response Id in the job config, so I will get that added.\r\nRowan Neri\r\n  12:06 PM\r\nyea i was thinking about including a developer tool for loading and  validating partner completeness across the configs as well\r\n12:08\r\ncurious though, are there issues with the current design that you think would warrant splitting it out? i.e. lots of failures or frequent or arduous partner changes/additions\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n  12:08 PM\r\nfrequent or arduous partner changes/additions\r\nThis is more where my mind goes.\r\nWill the base dag be enough to handle any partner specific asks\r\n12:09\r\nbased on the config structure\r\nRowan Neri\r\n  12:14 PM\r\nIll wait for the ticket updates on dev-8109 so i get the full picture\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n  12:14 PM\r\nSounds good\r\n12:14\r\nthanks for the work man\r\nRowan Neri\r\n  12:15 PM\r\nand btw when creating a new ticket, does the story need an epic or can i  just create the story\r\nJohnathan Neil\r\n  12:16 PM\r\nWe will want it in an epic, but product owners will determine that when we groom it.\r\nIt should be fine without one for now, just link your ticket in data_eng with a note that we should speak about it on thursday",
