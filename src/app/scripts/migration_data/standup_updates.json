Yeah, I guess I'll say spare the details and I did add some additional test coverage and implemented as well the enrich enrichment task logic for merging in the flags.\nAnd push those series of commits and and and today I'm going to continue validating the enrichment behavior and to end just testing with Airflow and locally and and expanding test coverage.\nUm, if possible where I can.
