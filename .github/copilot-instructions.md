## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


A knowledge management and productivity system built around the DIKW (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom) pyramid with specialized components for meeting intelligence, career development, and sprint management.

Core Business Components:

1. DIKW Knowledge Management (90/100)
- Hierarchical knowledge promotion through DIKW levels
- Custom signal synthesis algorithms for knowledge item merging
- Tag-based knowledge clustering with mindmap generation
- Confidence scoring system for knowledge validation

2. Meeting Intelligence System (85/100)
- Signal extraction framework for decisions, actions, blockers, risks
- Multi-source transcript processing with semantic deduplication 
- Meeting bundle synthesis with context preservation
- Screenshot analysis integration with transcript content

3. Sprint Management & Career Development (80/100)
- Sprint transition workflow with time tracking archival
- Career capability synthesis and recommendation engine
- Standup analytics with sentiment analysis
- Task decomposition with AI-powered time estimation

4. Command Pattern System (75/100)
- Hierarchical command system with domain categories
- Natural language command inference
- Context-aware suggestion rotation
- Frequency-based command ranking

5. Knowledge Graph Implementation (85/100)
- Custom DIKW pyramid schema
- Signal relationship mapping
- Person mention tracking
- Domain-specific traversal patterns

The system integrates these components through:
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for signal processing
- Agent Communication Bus for multi-agent coordination
- Workflow Mode Management with 7 distinct operational modes
- Hybrid retrieval combining lexical and semantic search
