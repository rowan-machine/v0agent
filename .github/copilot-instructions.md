## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a sophisticated meeting intelligence and career development platform with several interconnected business components:

DIKW Knowledge Management Engine (Importance: 90/100)
- Hierarchical knowledge synthesis pipeline (Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom)
- Custom promotion rules between DIKW levels with validation gates
- Signal-based knowledge extraction with semantic deduplication
- Relationship tracking and knowledge graph integration

Meeting Intelligence System (Importance: 85/100) 
- Multi-stage signal extraction from meetings (decisions, actions, blockers, risks)
- Template-based meeting classification with 30+ meeting types
- Automated mindmap generation with hierarchy detection
- Signal confidence scoring with feedback loop

Career Development Tracking (Importance: 80/100)
- Evidence-based skill progression tracking
- Integration of meeting signals with career growth
- Code change analysis for skill validation
- Personalized development recommendations

Agent Communication Framework (Importance: 75/100)
- Priority-based message routing between AI agents
- Context preservation across agent interactions
- Human-in-loop review workflow
- Feedback-driven learning system

Core Integration Points:
1. Signals feed into knowledge synthesis pipeline
2. Career evidence collected from meeting signals
3. Agent communications drive knowledge collection
4. Human feedback improves signal extraction

The system uses a thread-based conversation model with 24-hour retention and maintains bidirectional sync between local and cloud storage with conflict resolution.
