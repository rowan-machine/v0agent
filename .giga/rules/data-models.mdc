## Core Data Models (Importance: 75/100)

Two primary data models form the foundation of the system:

### Meetings
- Core data structure for meeting records
- Includes temporal attributes with specialized UTC/Central Time handling
- Supports flexible date parsing for both date-only and datetime formats

### Documents
- Document record structure 
- Integrated with meeting relationships
- Shares temporal handling characteristics with meetings model

## Relationship Structure (Importance: 65/100)

The models support hybrid content relationships:
- Cross-referencing between meetings and documents
- Content-based linking for query system integration
- Maximum context limit enforcement (6 items)
- Date-based relationship tracking for temporal queries

## Time Handling (Importance: 70/100)

Domain-specific datetime implementations:
- Automatic timezone conversion (UTC to America/Chicago)
- Flexible parsing of date formats
- Temporal relationship maintenance between records
- Date-based filtering support for queries
