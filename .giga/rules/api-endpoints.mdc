## Core API Routes
Importance Score: 65/100

The API endpoints implement specialized business logic for:

1. Query Processing Endpoints
- Hybrid search across meetings and documents
- Source-filtered retrieval (meetings/documents/both)
- Context limit enforcement (6 items maximum)
- Date-based filtering with timezone handling

2. LLM Integration Endpoints
- Context-aware query responses with source citations
- Meeting retrieval agent with domain-specific system prompts
- Response generation with required source attribution

3. Temporal Data Handling
- UTC to Central Time (America/Chicago) conversion logic
- Flexible date parsing for meeting/document records
- Timezone-aware record management

Key Business Rules:
- Maximum context limit of 6 items for LLM processing
- Required source citations in square brackets [1], [2]
- Hybrid search results must include date recency ranking
- All temporal data must be converted to America/Chicago timezone
