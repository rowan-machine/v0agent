## Core Data Models

### Meetings Model
- Primary container for collaborative session data
- Links to multiple Documents and Signals
- Specialized fields:
  - Meeting template type (30+ business templates) 
  - Signal extraction confidence scores
  - Semantic context vectors
  - DIKW pyramid stage markers
- Supports hierarchical meeting relationships
Importance Score: 90/100

### Documents Model 
- Core knowledge artifact storage
- Complex relationships with Meetings, Signals, Knowledge Items
- Domain-specific attributes:
  - Knowledge state tracking (Data/Info/Knowledge/Wisdom)
  - Signal extraction markers
  - Semantic relationship scores
  - Template classification tags
- Versioned document history with signal preservation
Importance Score: 85/100

## Key Relationships

### Meeting-Document Links
- Bidirectional references between meetings and documents
- Semantic similarity scores for automatic linking
- Signal inheritance patterns between related items
- Template-based relationship rules

### Signal Connections
- Maps extracted signals across meetings and documents
- Maintains DIKW promotion history
- Tracks signal confidence evolution
- Links related signals by semantic similarity

### Knowledge Evolution Chain
- Tracks progression through DIKW hierarchy
- Maintains source relationships during promotion
- Documents transformation history and confidence
- Preserves context during knowledge evolution
