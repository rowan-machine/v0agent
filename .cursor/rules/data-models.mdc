# data-models

Two primary data models form the core business structure:

1. Meeting Model
- UUID-based identification
- Hierarchical structure with linked documents and signals
- Status tracking: draft, active, archived
- Custom fields for:
  - Synthesis depth levels (0-2)
  - Signal categorization (decisions, actions, blockers)
  - Template type detection (30+ supported formats)

2. Document Model
- Multi-source document handling
- Integration with meeting bundles
- Bidirectional relationships with:
  - Meeting transcripts
  - Screenshots
  - Mind maps
  - Generated summaries
- DIKW level classification

Key Relationships:
- Meeting <-> Document: Many-to-many with relationship metadata
- Meeting -> Signals: One-to-many with signal categorization
- Document -> Knowledge Items: One-to-many with DIKW hierarchy

Unique Aspects:
1. Template-based meeting classification system
2. Signal extraction and categorization framework
3. DIKW hierarchy implementation for knowledge organization
4. Multi-source document bundling with relationship tracking

Importance Score: 90/100
