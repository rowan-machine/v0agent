# data-models

The system implements two primary data models with specialized domain relationships:

## Meeting Model
Importance Score: 85

Key Attributes:
- Title and synthesized content from meeting notes
- Extracted signals (decisions, actions, blockers, risks, ideas)
- Screenshot references with AI-processed context
- Relationships to source documents and transcripts
- Vector embeddings for semantic search

## Document Model
Importance Score: 80

Key Attributes:
- Source content with hierarchical section structure
- Signal classification metadata
- Related meeting references
- Vector-based content representation
- Knowledge graph node relationships

## Relationship Structure

Meetings and Documents are connected through:
1. Signal Extraction Links
- Signals extracted from documents link to source meetings
- Meeting signals reference original document contexts

2. Knowledge Graph Integration
- DIKW pyramid organization
- Hierarchical categorization between docs and meetings
- Tag-based clustering relationships
- Time-based evolution tracking

3. Context Preservation
- Meeting screenshots link to document sections
- Document sections maintain meeting reference history
- Signal merging across related items
- Embedded vector relationships for semantic connections
