## Core Data Models (Importance Score: 90/100)

The system is built on two primary domain entities:

1. Meetings
- Core organizational memory unit representing discussions and interactions
- Contains temporal metadata for time-based querying
- Links to related documents and context

2. Documents  
- Represents organizational knowledge artifacts
- Associated with meetings and conversations
- Contains searchable content and metadata

## Relationship Structure (Importance Score: 85/100)

The data models implement a hybrid memory architecture:

- Meetings and documents maintain bidirectional relationships
- Content is organized with temporal context preservation
- Query planning system traverses relationships for context building
- Memory retrieval engine handles hybrid source type queries across both models

## Integration Points (Importance Score: 80/100)

Key model integration occurs in:

src/app/memory/retrieve.py:
- Implements domain-specific retrieval across both models
- Maintains temporal ordering of retrieved content
- Handles hybrid queries spanning meetings and documents

src/app/chat/context.py:
- Assembles conversation context from both models
- Combines conversation history with relevant memory blocks
- Preserves relationships during context assembly
