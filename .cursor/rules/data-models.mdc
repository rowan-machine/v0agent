# data-models

The system implements two primary data models with sophisticated relationships:

## Meeting Model
Importance Score: 90/100

Core fields:
- UUID identifier
- Title & description  
- Meeting date/time
- Summary content
- Extracted signals:
  - Decisions
  - Action items 
  - Blockers
  - Risks
  - Ideas
- Related documents
- Participants
- Status tracking

## Document Model
Importance Score: 85/100

Core fields:
- UUID identifier
- Title & description
- Document type 
- Content/body
- Related meetings
- Version history
- Signal references
- Knowledge category
- DIKW pyramid level

## Relationship Structure

Bidirectional linking between meetings and documents with:
- Signal cross-referencing
- Knowledge hierarchy mapping
- Context preservation
- Temporal relationships
- Participant attribution

Knowledge items are classified within the DIKW pyramid levels:
- Data: Raw meeting/document content
- Information: Structured extracts
- Knowledge: Analyzed patterns
- Wisdom: Strategic insights

The models support:
- Signal propagation through related items
- Automatic knowledge categorization
- Meeting-document context linking
- Temporal relationship tracking
- Multi-level attribution
