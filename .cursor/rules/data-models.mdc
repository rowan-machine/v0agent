Core Data Models and Relationships:

1. Meeting Model
Importance Score: 90/100

- Domain-specific meeting categorization:
  - Regular standup
  - Sprint planning
  - Retrospective
  - Design review
  - Code review

- Signal extraction structure:
  - Decisions
  - Action items
  - Blockers
  - Risks
  - Ideas

- Meeting metadata:
  - Participants
  - Signal count by type
  - Mode (A-G workflow phase)
  - Sprint association
  - Knowledge graph connections
  - Parent/child meeting relationships

2. Document Model  
Importance Score: 85/100

- Document categorization:
  - Technical specs
  - Implementation plans
  - Code reviews
  - Architecture diagrams
  - Career development plans

- Document metadata:
  - Author
  - Related meetings
  - Signal references
  - Mode association
  - Sprint context
  - Knowledge level (DIKW pyramid)

3. Model Relationships
Importance Score: 95/100

- Meeting-Document Connections:
  - Reference type (source/derivation)
  - Signal inheritance flow
  - Context preservation
  - Knowledge promotion path
  - Mode transitions

- Signal Propagation Rules:
  - Parent-child signal inheritance
  - Cross-document signal merging
  - Meeting-to-document signal flow
  - Knowledge graph edge creation
  - Mode-based routing

The data models support specialized workflows around meeting intelligence, signal extraction, and knowledge management through the DIKW hierarchy.
