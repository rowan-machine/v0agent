description: Documents data model structures and relationships for enterprise memory management system
---


# data-models

The system implements two primary data models that form the foundation of the enterprise memory management system:

## Meeting Model
Location: src/app/meetings.py
- Stores meeting content and metadata
- Integrated with vector embeddings for semantic search
- Maintains temporal relationship tracking

## Document Model
Location: src/app/documents.py
- Implements hybrid storage combining SQL and vector embeddings
- Automatic synchronization between document changes and vector store
- Managed through unified embedding generation pipeline

## Model Relationships
The models are interconnected through:

1. Memory Integration Pipeline
- Unified embedding generation system
- Synchronized vector store updates
- Consistent document change tracking

2. Hybrid Storage Architecture
- Combined SQL database for structured data
- Vector embeddings for semantic search capabilities
- Automated synchronization between storage layers

## Business Rules
- Document updates trigger automatic embedding regeneration
- Meeting content gets processed through the same vector pipeline as documents
- Temporal relationships are maintained for both meetings and documents
- Storage model supports bidirectional updates between SQL and vector stores

IMPORTANCE SCORE: 85/100
The data models are critical business components as they enable the core functionality of enterprise memory management while supporting advanced semantic search capabilities.
