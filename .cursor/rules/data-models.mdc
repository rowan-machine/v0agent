## Core Data Models

### Meetings Model
Importance Score: 85/100

Primary data model for capturing meeting information and associated signals:
- UUID-based identification
- Structured signal extraction storage (decisions, actions, blockers, risks, ideas)
- Meeting metadata including date, duration, participants
- Screenshot bundle relationships for visual context
- Signal relationship tracking with version history

### Documents Model  
Importance Score: 80/100

Knowledge artifact storage with signal extraction capabilities:
- Document versions with full history
- Signal extraction markers for parsed content
- Topic and category classification
- Relationship mapping to meetings and other documents
- DIKW hierarchy classification (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom)

## Relationships

### Signal Relationships
- Meetings -> Signals (1:many)
- Documents -> Signals (1:many) 
- Signals -> Related Signals (many:many)
- Signal status tracking (pending, approved, rejected, archived)

### Knowledge Graph Relationships
- Documents -> Topics (many:many)
- Meetings -> Topics (many:many)
- Topics -> Topics (hierarchical)
- DIKW promotion chains

### Sprint Integration
- Meetings -> Sprint association
- Documents -> Sprint documentation
- Signal -> Sprint action items
- Sprint -> Mode tracking
