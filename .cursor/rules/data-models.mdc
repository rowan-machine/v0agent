# data-models

Two primary data models form the core of the application:

## Meetings Model
- Hierarchical organization with parent/child relationship support
- Meeting signals categorization into 5 types:
  - Decisions (green)
  - Action Items (orange)
  - Blockers (red) 
  - Risks (yellow)
  - Ideas (purple)
- Signal status workflow states:
  - Pending
  - Approved 
  - Rejected
  - Archived
  - Waiting
- Contains metadata for signal count tracking per meeting
- Meeting state persistence for collapsible view management
- Lifecycle management for working days calculation

## Documents Model
- DIKW (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) hierarchy support 
- Bidirectional relationships between documents through knowledge graph
- Cross-linking with meetings for contextual reference
- Signal extraction and validation tracking
- Version control integration for implementation tracking
- Sprint transition validation rules

## Relationship Structure
- Hierarchical parent/child organization for meetings
- Many-to-many relationships between meetings and documents
- Knowledge graph connections for semantic relationships
- Signal cross-referencing between meetings and documents
- Sprint-based archival relationships
- Career development evidence linking
