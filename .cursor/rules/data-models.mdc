## Core Data Models

### Meetings Model
Importance Score: 90
- Complex meeting data structure with multi-source transcript support
- Signal extraction and categorization system:
  - Decisions
  - Action items 
  - Blockers
  - Risks
  - Ideas
- Metadata tracking:
  - Source type (Teams, Pocket, etc)
  - Participant mapping
  - Signal relationships
  - Document correlations
- 24-hour conversation persistence with cleanup

### Documents Model
Importance Score: 85
- Bidirectional linking with meetings
- Hierarchical signal organization
- Custom versioning system ("code locker")
- Domain-specific metadata:
  - Implementation plans
  - Signal extractions
  - Meeting references

## Relationship Structure

### Meeting-Document Relationships
- Direct linkage between meetings and referenced documents
- Automatic correlation based on content analysis
- Signal inheritance across related items
- Version tracking for document references

### Signal Mapping
- Cross-reference system between meetings and documents
- Bidirectional signal propagation
- Relationship strength scoring
- Context preservation across references

### Content Organization
- Hierarchical structure for document management
- Meeting bundle system for transcript aggregation
- Signal categorization framework
- Context-aware relationship mapping
