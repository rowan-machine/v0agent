# data-models

IMPORTANCE SCORE: 75/100

Two primary data models form the core of the system:

1. Meetings Model
- Structured representation of meeting content with signal extraction
- Properties:
  - title, date, participants
  - raw_transcript: Original meeting text
  - synthesized_notes: AI-processed summary
  - signals: Extracted business signals (decisions, actions, risks)
  - screenshots: Visual context from meeting
  - related_docs: Linked document references

2. Documents Model  
- Knowledge artifacts with version control and relationships
- Properties:
  - title, created_date, updated_date
  - content: Main document text
  - doc_type: Type classification (spec, design, notes)
  - related_meetings: Associated meeting references
  - signals: Extracted business signals
  - versions: Historical content snapshots

Key Relationships:
- Meeting <-> Document: Many-to-many with context preservation
- Meeting -> Signals: One-to-many for extracted business intelligence 
- Document -> Versions: One-to-many for change tracking
- Meeting <-> Meeting: Predecessor/successor relationships for series

The models emphasize:
1. Signal extraction and classification
2. Relationship tracking between knowledge artifacts
3. Version control of document evolution
4. Meeting context preservation
5. Business intelligence derivation from raw content
