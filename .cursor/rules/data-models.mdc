# data-models

The system utilizes two primary data models that form the core business structure:

## Meeting Model (Importance: 90/100)
Location: src/app/mcp/parser.py

Core attributes:
- Structured signals extraction from unstructured text
- Domain-specific sections (Decisions, Action Items, Blockers, Risks, Ideas)
- Special "Synthesized Signals" section with prioritized handling
- Organization-specific formatting rules
- Time-based relevance scoring

## Document Model (Importance: 85/100)
Location: src/app/memory/rank.py

Core attributes:
- Custom organizational knowledge hierarchy
- Business-specific JSON transformation structure
- Source type preferences
- Time-based context tracking

## Relationship Structure (Importance: 80/100)
- Hierarchical organization (meetings > documents > transcripts)
- Cross-referencing between meetings and related documents
- Signal categorization with domain context
- Hybrid scoring system for combined document/meeting queries
