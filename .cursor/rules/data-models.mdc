## Core Models

### Meeting Model
- Unique identifier + metadata
- Contains signals array for storing extracted insights
- Links to multiple Document records via document_refs
- Temporal tracking (start_time, end_time, duration)
- Attendance tracking with participant metadata
- Meeting type classification (standup, sprint, review)

### Document Model  
- Unique identifier + metadata
- Parent/child relationship tracking for document hierarchies
- Signal extraction status tracking
- Document type classification (meeting notes, screenshots, transcripts)
- Version history for document content
- Links to related Meeting records via meeting_ref

## Model Relationships

### Meeting -> Document
- One-to-many relationship 
- Meeting can reference multiple associated documents
- Document types tied to specific meeting contexts
- Maintains signal extraction status between documents and meetings

### Document -> Meeting
- Many-to-one relationship
- Documents link back to parent meeting
- Tracking of document origin context
- Document version linked to meeting timeline

## Signal Storage

### Meeting Signals
- Stored as structured array within Meeting model
- Signal types: decisions, action items, blockers, risks, ideas
- Each signal contains:
  - Classification type
  - Extracted content
  - Assignee (if applicable)
  - Status tracking
  - Approval state

### Document Signals  
- Extracted from document content
- Mapped to meeting signals
- Maintains source tracing
- Links to specific document sections
