# data-models

## Meeting Model
Importance Score: 90

Primary data model for meeting records with specialized fields:
- `signal_categories`: Enumeration of extracted signal types (decisions, actions, blockers, risks, ideas)
- `signal_confidence`: Confidence scoring (1-10) for extracted signals
- `signal_status`: Signal lifecycle states (raw, validated, rejected, archived)
- `meeting_type`: Meeting classification (standup, planning, review, retro)
- `context_chain`: Linked list of related previous meetings
- `dikw_level`: Current position in DIKW hierarchy (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom)

## Document Model
Importance Score: 85

Knowledge artifact storage with business-specific fields:
- `doc_type`: Document classification (notes, specification, design, implementation)
- `semantic_hash`: Vector representation for similarity matching
- `source_signals`: References to originating meeting signals
- `knowledge_stage`: Position in knowledge transformation pipeline
- `confidence_score`: Document validation confidence (1-10)

## Relationship Structure
Importance Score: 95

Complex relationship mapping between meetings and documents:
- `semantic_similar`: Documents with similarity score > 0.78
- `derived_from`: Documents created from meeting signals
- `referenced`: Cross-document citations and references
- `same_topic`: Theme-based clustering
- `blocks`: Dependency relationship for implementation
- `depends_on`: Prerequisite relationship

Knowledge items maintain bidirectional relationships with automatic updates when either side changes, enabling sophisticated knowledge graph traversal and signal tracking through the DIKW hierarchy.
