## Primary Data Models

### Meeting Model (Importance: 90/100)
- Core fields:
  - `signals`: List of extracted business signals (decisions, actions, blockers, risks)
  - `summary`: AI-generated meeting synopsis
  - `participants`: Attendee tracking with roles
  - `context`: Related sprint/project references
  - `linked_documents`: Bidirectional document relationships

### Document Model (Importance: 85/100) 
- Key attributes:
  - `document_type`: Categorization (specification, design, report)
  - `status`: Workflow state tracking
  - `relationships`: Knowledge graph connections
  - `extracted_signals`: Auto-detected business signals
  - `version_info`: Document evolution tracking

## Relationship Structure

### Document-Meeting Links (Importance: 80/100)
- Bidirectional relationship tracking
- Confidence scoring for auto-detected relationships
- Signal-based relationship inference
- Context-aware linking rules

### Signal Relationships (Importance: 85/100)
- Cross-entity signal propagation
- Signal categorization hierarchy 
- Signal merging rules
- Temporal signal tracking

### Knowledge Graph Integration (Importance: 90/100)
- DIKW hierarchy implementation
- Semantic relationship scoring
- Source attribution tracking
- Promotion/demotion rules between levels
