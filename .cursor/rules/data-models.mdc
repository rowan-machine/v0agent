# data-models

The system implements two primary data models with specialized business logic:

## Meeting Model (Importance: 90)
Core structure defining business meetings with:
- Intelligent signal extraction and categorization
- DIKW hierarchy classification of content
- Temporal relationship tracking between recurring meetings
- Auto-linking with transcripts and recordings
- Custom signal promotion workflow through knowledge levels

Key Business Rules:
1. Signal Classification
- Decisions require explicit approval markers
- Action items must have assigned owners
- Blockers automatically link to relevant tickets
- Risks require impact/probability assessment

2. Meeting Relationships
- Parent/child meeting hierarchy
- Series tracking for recurring meetings
- Cross-meeting signal correlation
- Historical context preservation

## Document Model (Importance: 85) 
Implements version-aware document management with:
- Bidirectional signal relationships
- Knowledge graph integration
- Custom metadata extraction
- Domain-specific categorization

Key Business Rules:
1. Document Classification
- Auto-categorization based on content analysis
- Required metadata based on document type
- Validation rules for completeness

2. Relationship Management
- Bidirectional linking with meetings
- Signal extraction and correlation
- Version control with signal preservation
- Knowledge graph position tracking

## Relationship Structure
- Meetings and Documents maintain many-to-many relationships through signals
- Signals act as connective tissue in knowledge graph
- Custom promotion rules govern signal movement through DIKW levels
- Temporal relationships track meeting series and document versions
- Bi-directional integrity constraints maintain graph consistency
