# data-models

Core Data Models:

## Meetings Model
- Unique identifier and metadata (title, date, duration)
- Linked transcript content with source tracking (Teams/Pocket)
- Signal collections (decisions, action items, blockers, risks) 
- Mind map relationships and hierarchies
- Screenshot collections with vision analysis results
- DIKW level classification and promotion tracking
Importance Score: 90/100

## Documents Model
- Document metadata and versioning
- Semantic chunking for knowledge extraction
- Bidirectional relationships to meetings and signals
- Tag-based categorization system
- Knowledge graph position tracking
- Cross-reference mapping to related content
Importance Score: 85/100

## Model Relationships
1. Meeting-Document Links
- Many-to-many relationships via junction table
- Semantic similarity scoring for auto-linking
- Contextual relationship types and strengths
- Bidirectional navigation capabilities

2. Signal Relationships
- Parent-child hierarchies for nested signals
- Cross-meeting signal threading
- Signal-to-document reference mapping
- Confidence scoring for relationship strength

3. Mind Map Integration
- Hierarchical node structure
- Cross-entity relationship mapping
- Visual position preservation
- Knowledge graph integration points

Key Implementation Features:
- DIKW pyramid progression tracking
- Signal extraction and categorization
- Semantic relationship scoring
- Knowledge hierarchy management
- Cross-entity reference system
