## Primary Data Models

### Meeting Model
- Core entity for tracking all meeting-related data
- Fields:
  - title: Meeting identifier
  - date: Meeting occurrence timestamp
  - type: Enumerated meeting category (standup, planning, review)
  - status: Current meeting state (draft, active, archived)
  - signals: One-to-many relationship with extracted meeting signals
  - participants: Many-to-many relationship with users
  - documents: One-to-many relationship with attached documents

### Document Model
- Container for meeting-related artifacts and references
- Fields:
  - content: Document body text
  - format: Document type (markdown, mindmap, notes)
  - meetings: Many-to-one relationship with parent meeting
  - signals: One-to-many relationship with extracted document signals
  - metadata: JSON field for format-specific properties

## Relationships

### Meeting-Document Relationship
- Documents are owned by exactly one meeting
- Meetings can have multiple associated documents
- Automatic document linking based on semantic similarity
- Document inheritance through meeting hierarchies

### Meeting-Signal Relationship 
- Signals extract key insights from meetings/documents
- Signals maintain reference to source meeting/document
- Signal categorization into decisions/actions/blockers
- Signal confidence scoring based on validation counts

## Business Rules
- Documents require parent meeting association
- Meeting status transitions follow strict workflow
- Signals maintain source tracking and validation counts
- Document linking uses semantic similarity threshold (0.78)
