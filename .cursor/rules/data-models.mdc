# data-models

Two primary data models form the core of the system:

1. Meeting Model
Importance Score: 90/100
- Central entity for knowledge capture and signal extraction
- Contains:
  - Transcript data with speaker identification
  - Extracted signals (decisions, actions, blockers, risks)
  - Knowledge relationships to documents and tickets
  - Contextual metadata for AI analysis
- Maintains bidirectional references with Documents model

2. Document Model
Importance Score: 85/100
- Knowledge artifact container with versioning support
- Contains:
  - Content with version history
  - Signal annotations and extractions
  - Related meeting references
  - DIKW hierarchy classification tags
- Links to Meetings through contextual relationships

Relationship Structure:
- Meetings ⟷ Documents: Many-to-many with context metadata
- Both models support the DIKW (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) hierarchy
- Signal extraction flows from Meetings to Documents
- Knowledge synthesis occurs across both model types
