  - Decisions
  - Action Items
  - Risks
  - Blockers
  - Ideas
- Document References
- Knowledge Graph Mappings

Key Business Rules:
- Maintains parent-child relationships between related meetings
- Links extracted signals to DIKW knowledge hierarchy
- Tracks signal promotion through knowledge levels
- Maps meeting relationships to sprints and tickets

## Documents Model
Importance Score: 85/100

Core Structure:
- Document ID (UUID)
- Content Type
- Related Meeting References
- Signal Mappings
- Knowledge Graph Position

- Documents can be linked to multiple meetings
- Maintains bidirectional references with meetings
- Tracks document position in DIKW hierarchy
- Maps document relationships to sprint artifacts

- Meetings and Documents maintain many-to-many relationships
- Both entities connect to the Knowledge Graph through signal mappings
- Signal promotion tracks progression through DIKW levels
- Sprint artifacts link to both meetings and documents
