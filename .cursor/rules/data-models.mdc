# data-models

Two primary data models form the core of the system:

## Meetings Model (Importance: 90/100)

Key attributes and relationships:
- Hierarchical signal storage (decisions, actions, blockers, risks, ideas)
- Synthesized content mapping with embedded metadata
- Knowledge graph connections tracking relationships between meetings
- Sprint cycle association and temporal context tracking
- Screenshot analysis results with vision AI metadata

## Documents Model (Importance: 85/100)

Key attributes and relationships:
- Signal extraction mappings for structured knowledge
- DIKW pyramid classification level
- Promotion history between pyramid levels
- Related meeting references and context chain
- Document category metadata for domain classification

Cross-Model Relationships:
1. Meeting-Document Connections
- Bi-directional references for context preservation
- Signal inheritance and promotion tracking
- Knowledge graph relationship types for semantic connections

2. Signal Propagation
- Shared signal categorization system
- Cross-reference tracking between source documents/meetings
- Hierarchical organization of extracted knowledge

3. Knowledge Classification
- DIKW pyramid implementation across both models
- Promotion workflows between levels
- Validation rules for level transitions

The models implement a sophisticated knowledge management system focused on extracting and organizing business intelligence from meetings and documents while maintaining semantic relationships and context.
