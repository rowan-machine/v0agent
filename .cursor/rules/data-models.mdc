# data-models

Two primary data models form the core of the system:

## Meetings Model
Importance Score: 90/100

Key attributes:
- Title and metadata
- Transcript content
- Extracted signals (decisions, actions, blockers, risks)
- Reference links to related Documents
- Status workflow states

Signal relationships:
- One meeting can have multiple signals
- Signals maintain meeting source reference
- Signals can be promoted to documents
- Signals have confidence scores (1-10)

## Documents Model
Importance Score: 85/100

Key attributes:
- Content with version history
- DIKW level categorization
- Parent/child document relationships
- Signal source tracking

Knowledge relationships:
- Documents can reference meetings
- Documents store extracted/promoted signals
- Documents maintain DIKW hierarchy position
- Documents track career evidence and skills

The data models emphasize:
1. Meeting intelligence extraction
2. Signal-based knowledge capture
3. DIKW pyramid organization
4. Evidence-based career tracking

Core relationships focus on:
- Meeting → Signal → Document promotion flow
- DIKW hierarchical organization
- Career evidence linkage
- Cross-reference preservation
