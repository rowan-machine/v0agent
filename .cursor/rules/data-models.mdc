## Core Data Models

### Meeting Model
- Primary container for all meeting-related data
- Unique fields:
  - `signals`: Array of extracted business signals (decisions, actions, risks, blockers)
  - `mode`: Current workflow mode (A-G) affecting signal extraction
  - `dikw_items`: References to DIKW hierarchy items generated from meeting
  - `confidence_score`: Signal extraction quality metric (0-100)

### Document Model
- Knowledge artifact container with DIKW integration
- Key attributes:
  - `dikw_level`: Current position in Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom hierarchy
  - `validation_count`: Number of confirmations before promotion
  - `signals`: Extracted business signals linked to document
  - `semantic_score`: Relationship strength to connected entities (0.0-1.0)

## Relationships

### Meeting-Document Links
- Bidirectional references between meetings and referenced documents
- Weighted relationship scoring based on:
  - Direct references in meeting notes
  - Shared signals
  - Topic similarity
  - Temporal proximity

### DIKW Hierarchy
- Progressive promotion system between levels:
  - Data → Information: Requires 3 validations
  - Information → Knowledge: Requires 5 validations
  - Knowledge → Wisdom: Requires 10 validations and multi-source confirmation
- Each promotion preserves full lineage tracking
- Automatic relationship strength decay over time (0.1/month)

### Signal Graph
- Links meetings and documents through extracted signals
- Signal types:
  - Decisions (highest weight)
  - Action Items
  - Blockers
  - Risks
  - Ideas (lowest weight)
- Automatic signal deduplication with 0.78 similarity threshold
