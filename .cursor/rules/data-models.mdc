# data-models

Two primary data models drive the core business logic:

## Meetings Model
Importance Score: 90

Structure:
- Meeting records with signals extraction
- Meeting types (standup, planning, review)
- Relationship mapping to documents and tickets
- Signal categorization (decisions, action items, blockers, risks, ideas)
- Semantic tagging and knowledge graph integration
- State management (draft, active, archived)

## Documents Model
Importance Score: 85

Structure:
- Document metadata and content storage
- DIKW hierarchy classification (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom)
- Multi-source integration (Pocket, Teams transcripts)
- Bidirectional linking with meetings
- Version tracking with change history
- Auto-categorization based on content analysis

## Relationship Architecture

Key Relationships:
1. Meeting → Document (source relationships)
2. Meeting → Meeting (related meetings)
3. Document → DIKW Items (knowledge hierarchy)
4. Signals → Meetings/Documents (origin tracking)

Business Rules:
- Meetings can have multiple source documents
- Documents promote through DIKW levels based on signal synthesis
- Signals maintain references to originating content
- Both models support semantic tagging for knowledge graph integration
