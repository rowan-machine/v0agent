# data-models

The system implements two primary data models with sophisticated relationship tracking:

## Meeting Model
Importance Score: 85/100

Key attributes:
- Hierarchical signal storage (decisions, actions, blockers, risks)
- Time-series metadata tracking with version history
- Multiple linked transcript versions with confidence scores
- Relationship tracking to Documents and DIKW items
- Custom mindmap synthesis status tracking
- Multi-participant context preservation

## Document Model 
Importance Score: 90/100

Key attributes:
- Semantic vector storage for similarity matching
- Hierarchical knowledge structure with parent/child tracking
- Signal extraction results with confidence scores
- Multi-stage processing status tracking
- Custom relationship types to Meetings and DIKW items
- Version control with change tracking

## Relationship Structure
- Bidirectional linking between Meetings and Documents
- Confidence scoring for relationship strength (0.0-1.0)
- Relationship type classification:
  - REFERENCE (direct mentions)
  - SEMANTIC (content similarity)
  - TEMPORAL (time-based connections)
  - CONTEXTUAL (shared participants/topics)
- Automatic relationship inference based on content analysis
- Chain detection for meeting series tracking

## Metadata Management
- Custom status lifecycle tracking
- Processing stage indicators
- AI confidence scores for extracted content
- Participant context preservation
- Time-series version tracking
- Change detection and diffing support

The models implement sophisticated relationship tracking with semantic similarity matching and hierarchical knowledge organization capabilities.
