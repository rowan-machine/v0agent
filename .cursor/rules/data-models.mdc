# data-models

The system is built around two primary data models that manage institutional knowledge:

## Meeting Model
Core entity representing organizational meetings with:
- Temporal organization with UTC timezone normalization
- Synthesis capabilities for content aggregation
- Date-aware content organization structure

## Document Model
Secondary entity for document management:
- Integration with meeting-centric data flow
- Date-based content classification
- Relationship mappings to associated meetings

## Relationship Structure
The models implement a dual-track information storage system:
- Meetings serve as the primary organizational unit
- Documents attach to meetings as supporting content
- Both models support temporal filtering and content synthesis
- Cross-model relationships enable multi-source context assembly

## Content Organization
- Central/UTC timezone handling ensures global consistency
- Date-based hierarchical structure for both models
- Synthesis capabilities merge content across related entities
- Meeting-document associations enable contextual retrieval

The data model architecture emphasizes temporal organization and meeting-centric knowledge management, implementing specialized synthesis capabilities for institutional knowledge retention.
