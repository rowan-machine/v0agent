# data-models

Importance Score: 75/100

The system implements a dual-model architecture centered around Meetings and Documents as primary data entities:

## Core Models

### Memory Sources
Two primary memory source types are implemented:
- Meetings: Time-bounded discussion records
- Documents: General knowledge artifacts

### Unified Search Model
The memory retrieval system implements a unified search interface across both models:
- Common ranking attributes for both sources
- Temporal metadata integration
- Source type preferences
- Unified relevance scoring

### Relationship Structure
Memory blocks maintain relationships through:
- Cross-referencing between meetings and related documents
- Temporal alignment for context building
- Source preference weighting in unified search results

### Context Management
The conversation context model integrates:
- Memory blocks from both source types
- Temporal metadata for relevance calculations
- Source type preferences during retrieval
