# data-models

Two primary data models form the core of the system:

## Meetings Model
Importance Score: 90

Core structure and relationships:
- Meeting bundles that aggregate related content:
  - Transcripts (from multiple sources)
  - Mindmaps 
  - Generated summaries
  - Action items
  - Signals

- Signal relationships:
  - Each signal links to source meeting
  - Signal type classification
  - Optional ticket conversion tracking
  - Signal validation status
  - Signal importance scoring

## Documents Model 
Importance Score: 85

Document hierarchy and associations:
- Multi-level document organization:
  - Root documents
  - Child documents 
  - Document versions
  - Related mindmaps

- Document relationships:
  - Meeting associations
  - Signal mappings
  - Knowledge item references
  - Version history tracking
  - Parent-child hierarchies

Relationship Structure:
- One meeting can have multiple documents
- Documents can be associated with multiple meetings
- Signals can reference both meetings and documents
- Documents maintain hierarchical relationships
- Version control tracks document evolution
- Mindmaps can link to both meetings and documents
