# data-models

The system implements two core domain models with specialized business relationships:

## Meeting Model
Importance Score: 90/100

Key Attributes:
- Title and summary
- Start/end timestamps
- Signal extraction status
- Knowledge graph status 
- Processing state tracking
- Signal mappings and relationships
- Sprint context association

Related Signals:
- Decisions
- Action Items 
- Blockers
- Risks
- Ideas
- Context Notes

## Document Model
Importance Score: 85/100

Key Attributes:
- Document type classification
- Signal extraction status
- Content vectorization state
- Parent meeting reference (if promoted)
- Knowledge graph mappings
- Sprint association
- Signal relationships

Signal Categories:
- Technical Decisions
- Requirements
- Design Elements
- Implementation Notes
- Risk Factors

## Model Relationships

Meeting-to-Document:
- One meeting can have multiple source documents
- Documents can be promoted to meeting status
- Shared signal inheritance structure
- Sprint context preservation

Signal Relationships:
- Cross-model signal linking
- Status propagation rules
- Type-based categorization
- Context preservation
- Sprint boundary handling

The models implement a sophisticated knowledge management system focused on extracting and maintaining structured business signals across meetings and documents while preserving contextual relationships.
