description: Documents the core Meeting and Document data models and their relationship structure in a knowledge management system
---


# data-models

The system is built around two primary data models and their relationships:

## Meeting Model
Importance Score: 90/100

Core Structure:
- Meeting metadata (title, date, duration)
- Extracted signals with categorization:
  - Decisions
  - Action Items  
  - Blockers
  - Risks
  - Ideas
- Contextual knowledge relationships
- Participant tracking
- State transitions (draft, active, archived)

## Document Model
Importance Score: 85/100

Core Structure:
- Document versioning
- Signal extraction mapping
- Related meeting references
- Knowledge graph connections
- Domain categorization
- Change history tracking

## Relationship Structure

1. Meeting-to-Document Links
- Bi-directional references 
- Signal propagation between entities
- Version-aware relationships
- Context preservation across entities

2. Signal Inheritance
- Signals can flow between meetings and documents
- Hierarchical signal organization
- Cross-reference tracking between sources
- Signal deduplication and merging

3. Knowledge Context
- DIKW pyramid organization
- Domain-specific categorization
- Entity relationships in knowledge graph
- Context preservation across entities
