## Core Data Models

### Meeting Model
- Stores meeting content with hierarchical signal classification
- Signal categories: decisions, action items, blockers, risks, ideas
- Status tracking system for each signal (approved, rejected, archived, waiting)
- Version control for meeting notes with diff tracking
- Meeting type classification (standup, sprint, allhands etc)

### Document Model 
- Domain-specific document versioning with comparison capabilities
- Multi-format content storage (markdown, plaintext)
- Semantic linking system between related documents
- Screenshot analysis integration
- Document-to-signal extraction pipeline

## Relationships

### Meeting-Document Links
- Bidirectional references between meetings and source documents
- Semantic similarity scoring (min threshold 0.78)
- Link categorization (referenced, derived, blocked-by)
- Version-aware relationship tracking

### Signal Extraction Pipeline
- Automated signal classification from both meetings and documents
- Hierarchical organization of extracted signals
- Cross-reference validation between sources
- Status lifecycle management
