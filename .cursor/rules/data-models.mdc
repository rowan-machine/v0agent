# data-models

Two primary data models form the core business structure:

1. Meeting Model
Importance Score: 90
- Complex meeting data structure incorporating:
  - Structured signals (decisions, actions, blockers, risks) 
  - Relationships to Documents and other Meetings
  - Signal status tracking and progression
  - Meeting bundle concept for grouped sessions
  - Multi-source transcript merging

2. Document Model  
Importance Score: 85
- Document hierarchy system with:
  - Knowledge graph connections
  - DIKW pyramid classification
  - Signal extraction capabilities
  - Version control tracking
  - Semantic relationship mapping

Key Relationships:
- Meetings <-> Documents: Bidirectional references for context preservation
- Meetings <-> Signals: One-to-many relationship with signal categorization
- Documents <-> DIKW: Hierarchical progression tracking
- Documents <-> Documents: Knowledge graph connections

The models implement a sophisticated knowledge management system focused on:
- Signal extraction and categorization
- Context preservation across related items
- Knowledge hierarchy progression
- Semantic relationship tracking
