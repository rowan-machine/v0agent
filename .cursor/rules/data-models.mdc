# data-models

Core business entities and relationships focused on meeting intelligence and knowledge management:

## Meetings Model
- Primary storage for meeting transcripts and metadata 
- Tracks meeting types: one-on-one, team sync, planning, reviews
- Maintains relationships to:
  - Extracted signals (decisions, actions, blockers, risks)
  - Participating team members
  - Related documents/tickets
  - Sprint context
  - Parent/child meeting references
- Meeting bundles capability for multi-source transcript merging
- Signal extraction status tracking

**Importance Score**: 85

## Documents Model
- Knowledge artifact storage with categorization
- Types include: design docs, RFCs, implementation plans, retros
- Links to:
  - Associated meetings and signals  
  - Parent/child document hierarchy
  - Sprint and milestone context
  - Authors and reviewers
- Version tracking for document evolution
- DIKW pyramid classification status

**Importance Score**: 80

## Core Relationships
1. Meeting -> Signal -> Document
   - Tracks how decisions/actions flow into documentation
   
2. Meeting -> Sprint -> Document
   - Associates artifacts with development cycles

3. Document -> DIKW Level
   - Maps knowledge progression through hierarchy

4. Meeting/Document -> Career Development
   - Links artifacts to professional growth tracking

The data model emphasizes:
- Signal-centric organization of knowledge
- Multi-source meeting transcript handling  
- Document versioning with DIKW progression
- Integration with sprint and career tracking
