# data-models

Two primary data models drive the system's knowledge management capabilities:

## Meetings Model
Importance Score: 90
- Structured representation of meeting intelligence:
  - Core meeting metadata (title, date, duration)
  - Extracted signals categorized as:
    - Decisions
    - Action items
    - Blockers
    - Risks
    - Ideas
  - Signal status tracking (approved, rejected, waiting, archived)
  - Knowledge graph relationships to related documents and other meetings
  - Vector embeddings for semantic search

## Documents Model 
Importance Score: 85
- Knowledge artifact representation:
  - Document classification within DIKW hierarchy
    - Data tier
    - Information tier
    - Knowledge tier
    - Wisdom tier
  - Confidence scoring for knowledge promotion
  - Automated signal extraction
  - Relationship mappings to meetings and other documents
  - Classification tags for domain organization

## Model Relationships
- Meetings and Documents are connected through:
  - Signal references
  - Knowledge graph edges
  - Temporal proximity
  - Content similarity scores
  - Shared context tags

## Signal Classification System
- Standardized signal types across both models:
  - Decision signals (meeting outcomes, document conclusions)
  - Action signals (tasks, next steps)
  - Risk signals (identified issues, potential problems)
  - Blocker signals (impediments, dependencies)
  - Idea signals (proposals, suggestions)
