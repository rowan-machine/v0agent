# data-models

Two primary data models with associated business logic:

## Meetings Model (Importance: 90/100)
Core entity for managing meeting intelligence and signal extraction:
- Meeting transcripts and summaries
- Extracted signals (decisions, actions, blockers, risks, ideas)
- Participant tracking and contributions 
- Meeting type classification
- Custom lifecycle states (scheduled, in-progress, completed, archived)

## Documents Model (Importance: 85/100)
Knowledge artifact storage with domain-specific processing:
- Document classification system
- Version control with change tracking
- Relationship mapping between documents
- Tag generation and categorization
- Custom entity extraction

## Relationships and Integration
- Meetings can generate multiple signals
- Signals can be converted to tickets or DIKW items
- Documents can be linked to meetings as references
- Signals can reference multiple documents
- Knowledge synthesis combines meeting and document signals

The data model implementation focuses on maintaining relationships between knowledge artifacts while supporting the signal intelligence workflow from extraction through synthesis.
