## Meeting Model (Importance: 85)

- Meeting entities maintain sophisticated metadata including:
  - Signal extraction status and confidence scores
  - DIKW pyramid classifications 
  - Version history with full change tracking
  - Meeting series grouping and relationship mapping
  - Template pattern detection results

- Custom fields track:
  - Extracted signal counts by category
  - Knowledge item relationships
  - Sprint/ticket associations
  - Historical template matches

## Document Model (Importance: 80)

- Document entities implement:
  - Hierarchical knowledge organization
  - Signal source tracking
  - Version-controlled content with diff tracking
  - Semantic relationship scoring with other documents
  - Template-based categorization

## Relationship Structure (Importance: 75)

- Bidirectional linking between meetings and documents
- Confidence scoring for automatically detected relationships
- Custom fields for relationship metadata:
  - Match confidence scores
  - Relationship type classification
  - Temporal connection strength
  - Citation tracking
  - Signal overlap metrics

- Knowledge graph integration points:
  - DIKW hierarchy position tracking
  - Cross-entity relationship strength scoring
  - Semantic clustering metadata
  - Historical relationship evolution
