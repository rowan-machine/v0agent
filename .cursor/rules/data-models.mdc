description: Defines core data model structure for meetings and documents with hybrid knowledge base relationships

# data-models

The system implements a hybrid knowledge base structure centered around two primary data models:

## Meeting Model
- Primary model for temporal-based information storage
- Contains structured conversation data with attribution
- Linked to temporal context for date-based retrieval
Importance Score: 85/100

## Document Model 
- Represents static knowledge base content
- Integrates with meeting context for hybrid information retrieval
Importance Score: 80/100

## Relationship Structure
- Bidirectional linking between meetings and documents
- Temporal awareness through meeting-document context mixing
- Hybrid retrieval capabilities combining both source types
- Context assembly with configurable size limits (MAX_CONTEXT = 6)
Importance Score: 90/100

## Domain-Specific Features
1. Source Attribution
- Required citation formatting ([1], [2])
- Maintained across model relationships
- Preserved during context synthesis

2. Temporal Context
- Date-based filtering for meetings
- Historical relationship tracking
- Time-aware information retrieval

3. Knowledge Base Integration
- Mixed source type querying
- Structured planning for source selection
- Context-aware relationship traversal
