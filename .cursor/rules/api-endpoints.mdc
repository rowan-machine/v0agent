# api-endpoints

FastAPI routes implementing core CRUD operations with the following business logic:

1. Meeting Signal Routes
File: src/app/api/v1/meetings.py
- Extracts and processes signals (decisions, action items, blockers) from meeting transcripts
- Implements meeting-document association with custom relationship tracking
- Handles meeting lifecycle with state transitions and signal aggregation
Importance Score: 80/100

2. DIKW Knowledge Management Routes 
File: src/app/api/v1/dikw.py
- Manages knowledge pyramid items with promotion workflows between levels
- Custom confidence scoring and validation logic for knowledge items
- Tracks knowledge evolution and relationships across pyramid levels
Importance Score: 85/100

3. AI Memory Integration Routes
File: src/app/api/v1/ai_memory.py
- Manages contextual memory with importance-based storage
- Implements semantic search over memory items
- Handles memory lifecycle with approval/archive/reject workflows
Importance Score: 90/100

4. Feedback Loop Routes
File: src/app/api/v1/feedback.py
- Collects signal feedback with confidence impact calculations
- Updates DIKW item confidence based on feedback patterns
- Implements holistic pattern recognition for signal validation
Importance Score: 80/100

5. Mindmap Analysis Routes
File: src/app/api/v1/imports.py
- Processes mindmap structures from images
- Extracts entities and relationships from visual hierarchies
- Generates DIKW items from mindmap patterns
Importance Score: 85/100

The endpoints implement sophisticated domain logic around:
- Knowledge management and synthesis
- AI memory context handling
- Feedback-driven confidence scoring
- Visual knowledge extraction
- Meeting intelligence processing
