## Meeting Signal Endpoints

Routes implementing meeting intelligence and signal extraction:

```python
/api/v1/meetings/signals
- Extracts decisions, action items, blockers and risks from meeting content
- Implements signal confidence scoring (0-100)
- Handles signal approval workflow states
- Routes signals to appropriate knowledge graph nodes

/api/v1/meetings/synthesis  
- Processes meeting content through DIKW hierarchy levels
- Merges related signals across multiple meetings
- Generates knowledge graph relationships
- Tracks signal promotion history
```

Importance Score: 85/100

## Document Processing Endpoints

Routes for document analysis and knowledge extraction:

```python
/api/v1/documents/analyze
- Processes documents through domain-specific classifiers
- Extracts structured signals and relationships
- Maps content to existing knowledge nodes
- Handles document version tracking

/api/v1/documents/knowledge
- Manages document-to-knowledge promotion workflow
- Implements DIKW hierarchy transitions
- Tracks document confidence scores
- Maintains semantic relationships
```

Importance Score: 80/100

## Knowledge Graph Endpoints

Routes managing the knowledge relationship system:

```python
/api/v1/knowledge/graph
- Maintains typed relationships between entities
- Handles bidirectional entity linking
- Implements graph-based suggestion system
- Manages entity confidence scores
```

Importance Score: 90/100

Key Business Rules:
1. Signal confidence thresholds determine promotion eligibility
2. Knowledge items require minimum relationship count
3. Document versions maintain ancestor links
4. Meeting signals auto-expire after 30 days unless promoted
