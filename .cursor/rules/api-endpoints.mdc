# api-endpoints

The API endpoints implement specialized knowledge management functionality focused on meetings and documents through these key routes:

## Search and Retrieval Endpoints
- Multi-source search capabilities across meetings and documents with temporal filtering
- Date-range bounded queries for institutional knowledge
- Source-type filtering for targeted content retrieval

## Meeting Management Endpoints
- Meeting synthesis and storage with timezone-aware handling
- Date-aware content organization
- Integration with central/UTC timezone system for global consistency

## Document Processing Endpoints
- Document storage with synthesis capabilities
- Parallel tracking alongside meeting content
- Temporal organization aligned with meeting data

## Question-Answer Endpoints
- Context-aware retrieval with source prioritization
- Multi-source context assembly (up to 6 sources)
- Structured response generation with source attribution
- Meeting-focused response constraints

## Common Features
- Domain-specific system prompts for meeting retrieval
- Source citation requirements and formatting
- Hybrid search implementation across content types
- Time-bounded search functionality
- Source-specific result formatting and prioritization

Importance Score: 75/100
The endpoints represent critical business functionality for knowledge management but utilize standard REST patterns for implementation.
