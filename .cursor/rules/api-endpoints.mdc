## Core API Routes

### Meeting Intelligence Endpoints
File: src/app/api/meetings.py
Importance Score: 85/100

- POST /meetings/analyze
  - Extracts structured signals from meeting transcripts
  - Categorizes content into decisions, action items, blockers, and risks
  - Implements domain-specific signal validation

- PUT /meetings/{id}/signals
  - Processes signal promotion through DIKW hierarchy
  - Maintains signal relationships and dependencies
  - Handles signal merging and synthesis logic

### Document Processing Routes
File: src/app/api/documents.py
Importance Score: 75/100

- POST /documents/extract
  - Implements document-to-meeting signal conversion
  - Maintains document hierarchy and relationships
  - Processes document metadata for signal context

- PUT /documents/{id}/knowledge
  - Handles knowledge graph integration
  - Maintains DIKW promotion history
  - Processes document relationships and references

### Signal Management Routes
File: src/app/api/signals.py
Importance Score: 80/100

- POST /signals/synthesize
  - Implements signal clustering and relationship detection
  - Processes signal promotion criteria
  - Maintains signal context and metadata

- PUT /signals/{id}/promote
  - Handles DIKW hierarchy transitions
  - Implements promotion validation rules
  - Maintains signal promotion audit trail

## Business Rules

1. Signal Extraction Logic
- Meeting content must be categorized into predefined signal types
- Signals require source context and metadata
- Duplicate signals must be merged based on content similarity

2. DIKW Promotion Rules
- Signals must meet level-specific criteria for promotion
- Promotions require minimum relationship counts
- Signal context must be preserved across promotions

3. Knowledge Graph Integration
- Documents must maintain bidirectional relationships
- Signal relationships require validation
- Graph updates must preserve existing relationships
