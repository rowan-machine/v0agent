## Meeting Management Routes
Importance Score: 85

Key endpoints implementing domain-specific meeting workflows:

1. Meeting Signal Processing
- POST /meetings/{id}/signals
  - Extracts structured signals (decisions, actions, risks) from meeting content
  - Applies custom signal categorization rules
  - Links signals to relevant tickets and documents

2. Meeting Bundle Operations  
- POST /meetings/bundle
  - Processes multi-source meeting transcripts (Teams, Pocket)
  - Merges related content with deduplication
  - Extracts participants and relationships

3. Meeting Knowledge Graph
- GET /meetings/{id}/graph
  - Generates meeting-specific knowledge subgraphs
  - Maps relationships between signals, people and documents
  - Provides temporal context for meeting content

## Document Operations 
Importance Score: 80

Document processing endpoints with specialized business logic:

1. Document Synthesis
- POST /documents/synthesize
  - Implements DIKW pyramid promotion rules
  - Merges related document fragments
  - Maps document-signal relationships

2. Document Signals
- GET /documents/{id}/signals
  - Extracts actionable signals from documents
  - Categories signals by business impact
  - Links to relevant meetings and tickets

The remaining standard CRUD operations for meetings and documents have been omitted as they implement basic functionality without specialized business logic.
