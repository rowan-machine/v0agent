# api-endpoints

Core API routes for meeting and document intelligence system:

1. Meeting Signal Management
Path: `/api/v1/meetings/signals`
- Extracts and categorizes business signals from meeting content
- Processes signals into structured categories:
  * Decisions
  * Action Items
  * Blockers
  * Risks
  * Ideas
- Maintains signal relationships and context chains
- Auto-classifies signal importance using domain rules
- Handles signal merging across related meetings

2. Meeting Context Management 
Path: `/api/v1/meetings/context`
- Maintains contextual knowledge graph for meetings
- Links related meetings through signal overlap analysis
- Tracks meeting series and recurring patterns
- Preserves business context across meeting cycles

3. Document Signal Processing
Path: `/api/v1/docs/signals`  
- Extracts business signals from document content
- Maps document signals to meeting contexts
- Handles bi-directional signal propagation
- Maintains document-meeting relationship graph

4. Signal Query System
Path: `/api/v1/signals/search`
- Multi-dimensional signal filtering and search
- Context-aware signal retrieval
- Category-based signal aggregation
- Time-based signal correlation

Importance Score: 85/100
The API endpoints implement sophisticated business logic for extracting, categorizing and managing business signals across meetings and documents. The signal extraction and context preservation capabilities represent core domain-specific functionality.
