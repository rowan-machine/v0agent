# api-endpoints

Based on the provided specification, the API endpoints focus on integrating multiple knowledge management systems through a unified interface:

## Memory Integration Routes

Key integration points for the hybrid storage system:
- Document creation/update endpoints synchronize with vector embeddings store
- Meeting routes handle automatic embedding generation
- Combined SQL and vector storage operations for knowledge persistence

## Retrieval Endpoints

Sophisticated search endpoints implementing:
- Hybrid semantic + traditional search capabilities  
- Source-aware document retrieval with custom prioritization
- Temporal-based filtering (recent vs historical content)

## Context-Aware Chat Endpoints

Chat interaction routes featuring:
- Dynamic context building and management
- Question analysis and routing
- Source attribution tracking
- Evidence collection from multiple knowledge sources

## Ranking Routes

Custom ranking endpoints implementing:
- Multi-factor document scoring
- Source type weighting
- Temporal relevance calculations
- Term density analysis
- Recent content prioritization (30/90 day windows)

## Memory Management 

Routes for managing the conversational memory system:
- Stateful conversation tracking
- Context window management
- Fallback query handling
- Retrieval augmented generation integration
