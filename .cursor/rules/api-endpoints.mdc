## Meeting Management Endpoints

1. Signal Processing Routes
- POST /api/meetings/{id}/signals
  - Extracts and categorizes meeting signals into decisions, action items, blockers, risks and ideas
  - Implements custom signal validation workflow
  - Associates signals with meeting context and participants

2. Meeting State Management
- PUT /api/meetings/{id}/state
  - Controls meeting workflow states: draft, in-progress, completed, archived
  - Manages signal extraction triggers based on state transitions
  - Links meeting artifacts (transcripts, recordings) based on state

3. Document Integration Routes
- POST /api/meetings/{id}/documents
  - Associates relevant documentation with meeting context
  - Extracts signals from attached documents
  - Creates knowledge graph relationships between meetings and docs

## Document Management Endpoints 

1. Signal Extraction Routes
- POST /api/documents/{id}/process
  - Processes documents for business signals
  - Categorizes extracted information into defined signal types
  - Maps document sections to meeting contexts

2. Document State Control
- PUT /api/documents/{id}/state
  - Manages document workflow through states: draft, review, approved, archived
  - Triggers signal reprocessing on state changes
  - Updates associated meeting signal graphs

3. Document Context Routes
- GET /api/documents/{id}/context
  - Retrieves related meetings and signal chains
  - Provides document hierarchy in knowledge graph
  - Maps document signals to meeting outcomes
