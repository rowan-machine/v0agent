# api-endpoints

The API implements specialized endpoints for meeting and document management:

## Meeting Management
Importance Score: 85/100

- `/api/meetings/analyze`
  - Extracts and categorizes signals from meeting content
  - Processes structured and unstructured meeting notes
  - Auto-categorizes decisions, action items, blockers and risks
  - Links related documents and tickets through semantic similarity

- `/api/meetings/signal-extraction` 
  - Implements custom signal extraction pipeline
  - Processes 30+ meeting template formats
  - Hierarchical categorization of business signals
  - Integration with knowledge graph for relationship mapping

## Document Intelligence
Importance Score: 80/100

- `/api/documents/dikw`
  - Handles DIKW (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) hierarchy
  - Manages knowledge promotion through pyramid levels
  - Tracks confidence scores for promoted items
  - Implements feedback loop for signal validation

- `/api/documents/synthesis`
  - Merges related knowledge items based on semantic similarity
  - Auto-generates tags and clusters for knowledge management
  - Handles bidirectional linking with relationship typing
  - Maintains confidence scoring system for links (0.0-1.0)

## Memory Management 
Importance Score: 90/100

- `/api/memory/context`
  - Manages contextual AI conversation memory
  - Implements importance-based memory prioritization (1-10)
  - Handles memory confidence scoring with feedback
  - Controls context injection with token budgets

- `/api/memory/boost`
  - Calculates memory boost factors from feedback
  - Adjusts signal confidence based on user interactions
  - Manages promotion tracking with validation counts
  - Handles decay rates for older memories
