# api-endpoints

Based on the provided specification, there is limited direct information about specific API endpoints. However, the system architecture implies the following high-level REST API structure related to the core business functionality:

Primary Resource Endpoints:
- Meeting management endpoints
- Document management endpoints 

These endpoints integrate with the following key business components:

1. Query Planning Integration
- Endpoints must interface with the specialized query planning logic (src/app/chat/planner.py)
- Routes handle conversation context and query transformation parameters

2. Memory Retrieval Integration
- Search endpoints leverage the custom ranking algorithm
- Results combine both meeting and document sources
- Support for temporal filtering parameters

3. Conversation Context Management
- Stateful conversation endpoint support
- Context window management endpoints
- History merging capabilities

4. Chat Turn Processing
- QA workflow orchestration endpoints
- Fallback handling routes
- Support for both stateful/stateless modes

Importance Score: 75/100
The API endpoints serve as critical integration points for the core business logic around document/meeting management and intelligent query processing.
