---


# api-endpoints

The API routes specification focuses on meeting and document management with domain-specific implementation. Based on the provided information about the Meeting Processing Pipeline and Signal Extraction System, the following business logic patterns should be implemented in the endpoints:

## Meeting Endpoints (Importance: 85/100)
- Support specialized handling for meeting bundles containing summaries, transcripts and structured signals
- Enable processing of domain-specific sections like Decisions, Action Items, Blockers, Risks, Ideas
- Facilitate extraction and persistence of synthesized authoritative signals
- Implement organizational formatting standards for meeting summaries
- Support document hierarchy specific to meetings and transcripts

## Knowledge Retrieval Endpoints (Importance: 75/100) 
- Expose custom ranking functionality incorporating source type preferences
- Support time-based relevance querying
- Enable term matching with business context
- Implement hybrid scoring for documents and meetings
- Support domain-specific query planning with time context understanding

## Document Processing Endpoints (Importance: 70/100)
- Handle organization-specific document transformation
- Support business-specific JSON data structures
- Enable signal categorization and extraction pipeline operations
- Support organizational knowledge base querying requirements
- Implement response formatting per organizational standards
