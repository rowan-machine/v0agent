# api-endpoints

Based on the specification, the API endpoints are primarily focused on providing interfaces for the core business query and retrieval systems:

Query Planning Endpoints:
- Importance Score: 85/100
- Translates natural language queries into structured search parameters
- Determines source preferences between meetings and documents
- Extracts search concepts and temporal hints

Memory Retrieval Endpoints:
- Importance Score: 80/100
- Handles hybrid queries across meetings and documents
- Implements domain-specific document and meeting retrieval
- Returns temporally ordered content based on relevance scoring

Context Management Endpoints:
- Importance Score: 75/100
- Manages conversation state persistence
- Assembles contextual memory blocks
- Enforces context window limitations

Chat Flow Endpoints:
- Importance Score: 70/100
- Orchestrates conversation turns between user and memory system
- Manages conversation state persistence
- Implements query planning fallback mechanisms

The endpoints implement a multi-stage pipeline for:
1. Query planning and translation
2. Memory retrieval across hybrid sources
3. Context assembly and management
4. Conversational flow orchestration
