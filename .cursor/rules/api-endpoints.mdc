API routes implementing the meeting and document management system:

1. Meeting Signal Processing Routes
Importance Score: 85
- Custom signal extraction endpoints for processing meeting transcripts
- Auto-categorization of extracted signals into decisions, blockers, risks
- DIKW hierarchy promotion endpoints for meeting-derived knowledge
- Meeting bundle processing with transcript correlation

2. Document Intelligence Routes 
Importance Score: 80
- Semantic similarity matching for document relationships
- Knowledge graph integration endpoints
- Document signal extraction and classification
- Cross-document linking based on content relationships

3. Meeting Analytics Routes
Importance Score: 75
- Meeting effectiveness scoring endpoints
- Signal quality validation routes
- Historical meeting trend analysis
- Action item tracking and followup endpoints

4. Sprint Integration Routes
Importance Score: 70
- Meeting-to-sprint correlation endpoints
- Sprint signal aggregation 
- Meeting impact analysis for sprint planning
- Action item to ticket conversion

Core Business Rules:
- Meeting signals must be categorized into predefined types (decisions, blockers, risks)
- Documents must maintain bidirectional relationships in knowledge graph
- Meeting bundles require correlation with all associated transcripts
- Signals promote through DIKW hierarchy based on validation rules

The API's unique value lies in its sophisticated handling of meeting intelligence, document relationships, and knowledge promotion through the DIKW hierarchy.
